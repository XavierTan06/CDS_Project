"Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?",happiness
That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?,neutral
"Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .",neutral
"I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .",sadness
"I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .",neutral
"Well , it's all new stock in the window now .",neutral
"May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?",neutral
"Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .",neutral
"Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .",neutral
"Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .",neutral
"Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .",happiness
"That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .",neutral
"There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .",happiness

You need a babysitter .,neutral
"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .",neutral
I could have Suzy stay at my place .,neutral
"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",neutral
Why not ?,neutral
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,neutral

it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .,neutral
what should I bring with me ?,neutral
"we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .",neutral
I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .,neutral
do you like surfing ?,neutral
I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?,neutral
we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !,happiness
I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?,neutral
"you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .",neutral
"ok , where and when should I meet you ?",neutral
we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !,happiness
"Hi , what can I get for you ?",neutral
"Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ?",neutral
With everything on it ?,neutral
That sounds great .,happiness
Did you want fries with your order ?,neutral
May I get a large order of curly fries ?,neutral
Did you want something to drink ?,neutral
Get me a medium Pepsi .,neutral
Would you like anything else ?,neutral
"No , thank you . That's it .",happiness
"No problem , that'll be $ 5 . 48 .",happiness
Thanks a lot . Keep the change .,happiness
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?,anger
"Yeah , I'm afraid so .",anger
"If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .",anger
"Yes , it is annoying .",anger
See how many people are here !,neutral
Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here !,neutral
"Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company .",neutral
Can we just sit wherever we want ?,neutral
Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back .,neutral
"Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ?",neutral
Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing !,surprise
Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps !,disgust
Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you .,neutral
I just hope he doesn't start bragging again !,neutral
I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus !,happiness
"Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ?",happiness
"Good afternoon , how can I help you ?",neutral
Someone has stolen my gold necklace .,sadness
I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ?,neutral
Of course not .,neutral
Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ?,neutral
"Yes , I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ' t find it .",neutral
"Ok , when and where did you last see it ?",neutral
"Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower , and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it .",neutral
Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ?,neutral
"Yes , I am positive .",neutral
Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ?,neutral
"Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back .",anger
"Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ' s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .",neutral
That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now .,anger
"I am sorry , ma ' am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ' d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you .",neutral
You look kind of green .,neutral
I don ' t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach .,neutral
Have you had anything to eat lately ?,neutral
I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch .,neutral
Perhaps the food was bad .,neutral
"Perhaps , but I haven ' t felt well for a few days now .",sadness
Has anything been upsetting you lately ?,neutral
My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .,sadness
Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ?,neutral
It seems to me like I may have caught a bug .,sadness
"Hello , three-five .",neutral
Is that Anne ?,neutral
"I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again .",disgust
What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time .,surprise
It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes .,disgust
That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ?,sadness
"No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye .",disgust
But Anne ...,sadness
I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered .,anger
"Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night .",neutral
That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night .,anger
"Okay , sir , bear with me a moment .",neutral
Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .,neutral
"One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file .",neutral
You can,neutral
"I feel your pain , sir .",neutral
Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves .,anger
"I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here .",neutral
I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .,anger
"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?",neutral
"yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .",anger
"is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .",neutral
but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?,anger
"of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .",neutral
Excuse me sir . May I come in ?,sadness
"Mike , you're late again .",anger
"I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I",sadness
Do you think I believe the story like that ?,anger
But it's true .,neutral
How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?,anger
That's coincident .,neutral
"Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .",neutral
I promise I will .,neutral
You'd better .,neutral
"Hi , Victor . How are you ?",neutral
"Oh , I'm fine .",neutral
"So , are you going to go to class tonight ?",neutral
Maybe ... but I don't think so .,sadness
Really ? What's the matter ?,surprise
I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .,sadness
"Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .",happiness
"Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .",happiness
I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?,neutral
Yes . I think so . It ' s not a very expensive apartment . It ' s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .,happiness
"I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ' s very nice view from the balcony .",happiness
The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .,happiness
"Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks .",happiness
It ' s a pity we can ' t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .,sadness
"Yes , it would . Don ' t worry . There ' s a lawn outside the building and there ' s the park nearby . This place will be fine .",neutral
The building is quite new and well constructed . I ' m happy with the fittings too .,happiness
"Yes , everything has been well designed .",happiness
What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .,happiness
Thank you .,happiness
Is that your wedding ring ?,happiness
I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .,happiness
"Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?",happiness
In June .,happiness
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?,happiness
"Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .",happiness
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .,happiness
Thank you so much .,happiness
What kind of watch is it ?,neutral
It's a Tag Heer .,neutral
"If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?",neutral
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .,neutral
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .,happiness
Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .,happiness
"Well , Yuri , tell me about it .",neutral
"I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster .",neutral
That's what I was afraid of .,neutral
"It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides . Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .",neutral
Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .,surprise
"That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported . But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .",neutral
"Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country . But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes . Our operations here are finished !",sadness
"I'm sorry , sir .",sadness
"It's not your fault , Yuri . But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?",neutral
"Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .",neutral
Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .,neutral
But sir ...,neutral
"Yes , Yuri ?",neutral
I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now . Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .,neutral
Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?,neutral
"No , sir . The bridges are fine . But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . There has been fighting , sir .",neutral
Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .,neutral
"You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported .",neutral
"Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . No , I can't believe this mess !",sadness
"You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault . But me--I'm the one who should be sorry . It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ?",sadness
"Alright , tell me what you think about this one .",neutral
Don't you think it's a bit bright ?,neutral
"Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?",neutral
"That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?",neutral
"No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .",happiness
"I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .",neutral
"How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",neutral
That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .,happiness
"Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",happiness
That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?,happiness
"The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it .",happiness
"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?",happiness
Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest .,happiness
Really ? Congratulations !,happiness
"Thank you , Paul .",happiness
"By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .",neutral

"Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .",happiness
My pleasure .,happiness
"Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ?",neutral
"I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year .",happiness
That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show .,neutral
Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ?,happiness
"No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing .",neutral
Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me .,happiness
Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu .,happiness
Good !,happiness
"John , I ' Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ' t want to see you smoking in my office again .",anger
"I ' m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ' t let it happen again .",sadness
"That ' s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ' ll have to use your break time and go outside !",anger
"I understand , Ms . Fairbanks .",neutral
"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",fear
What is it ? What happened ?,neutral
I think someone is stalking me .,fear
"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",surprise
"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",fear
What did you do ?,neutral
"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",fear
Did he leave when you left ?,neutral
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,fear
"Marketing manage office , can I help you ?",neutral
"Mr Green , please .",neutral

"Todd , I am so happy you called !",happiness
"Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night .",happiness
"Boy , Todd , that was one great movie you picked out ! Thanks for asking me to go with you !",happiness
I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .,happiness
"A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ?",happiness
"Linda , that would be a perfect addition .",happiness
"I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?",happiness
I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike .,neutral
Nine is a great time to get started . I'll see you on Saturday !,neutral
Did your meal meet with your approval ?,neutral
Our meal was absolutely perfect !,happiness
How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ?,neutral
"Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends .",happiness
"On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp .",neutral
I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful .,happiness
"One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ?",neutral
"We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks , please ?",neutral
How about some coffee and tea as well ?,neutral
We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas .,neutral
I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away .,neutral
The hot drinks first would be great . Thanks !,happiness
"Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?",neutral
It was funny .,happiness
"Tell me about it , will you ?",neutral
"Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .",happiness
Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?,neutral
"Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .",happiness
You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?,happiness
We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .,happiness
So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .,happiness
"Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .",happiness
"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .",neutral
Stay for dinner with us .,happiness

Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .,happiness
"John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .",neutral
"I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .",neutral
You can't be serious !,anger
"Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .",anger
"After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .",anger
Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .,anger
"You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !",anger
Whatever you say !,anger
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !,neutral
Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .,neutral
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !,anger
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .,anger
I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .,anger
"You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .",happiness

It seems that is a better way . Thank you .,happiness
You are welcome .,happiness
I am so busy today .,neutral
Can I help you ?,happiness
I ' m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .,neutral
I ' ll be glad to help .,happiness
Or maybe make the beds .,neutral
All you have to do is ask for help .,happiness
Thanks . That ' s terrific !,happiness
I ' m ready and willing to help .,happiness
"Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .",happiness
You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .,happiness
Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .,happiness
"You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .",happiness
No wonder people say,happiness
"Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !",surprise
I didn't know you liked bird-watching .,happiness
"I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .",happiness
This looks like a very nice house .,happiness
"You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .",happiness
The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !,happiness
The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .,happiness
This home is gorgeous on the inside !,happiness
"Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .",neutral
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .,happiness
Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .,neutral
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .,happiness
The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .,happiness

"Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !",happiness
"Whoa , that ' s a lot of cash ! Let ' s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .",happiness
"All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ' s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !",happiness
"Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous .",happiness
Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .,sadness
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .,sadness
"Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control !",fear
"Can I have my check , please .",neutral
Here it is . 350 Yuan all together .,neutral
May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it .,happiness
Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt .,happiness
Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .,happiness

Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .,neutral
You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?,neutral
Yes .,neutral
Got it . Bye for now .,neutral
"Hi , Mary , I have decided to look for a job as a salesman .",neutral
Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ?,neutral
Yes . I have found some through different channels .,neutral
Really ? That's great ! Tell me .,surprise
"OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines .",neutral
What do you think of this job ?,neutral
"I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well .",neutral
Then how about the others ?,neutral
"Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments .",neutral
"I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development .",neutral
I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try .,neutral
Come on ! I believe you will succeed .,happiness
Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .,happiness
Good idea . I will think it over .,happiness
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable .,anger
"Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .",neutral
He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .,anger
I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .,neutral
"I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me .",anger
"Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss .",neutral
"Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .",sadness
Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper !,neutral
"Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself .",neutral
"No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions .",neutral
"But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless .",neutral
"Oh , no one is perfect .",neutral
That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .,neutral
We have the equal partnership in team .,neutral
Thanks very much and you're very eloquent .,happiness
Thanks for saying that .,happiness
That was really a nightmare !,fear
"Honey , what's up ?",neutral
I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .,fear
"Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?",surprise
I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .,fear
Did you panic at the time ?,neutral
"A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .",neutral
Was there anyone else with you ?,neutral
"Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .",neutral
So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?,neutral
Yes . I have to call the property management .,neutral
For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?,neutral
"Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .",neutral
That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .,neutral
"I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .",neutral
Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for !,happiness
You have good taste . It's made of red wood .,neutral
"Oh , I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ?",neutral
300 dollars .,neutral
That's sheer robbery !,anger
"Believe me , it's worth the price .",neutral
It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ?,neutral
How much are you willing to pay ?,neutral
Shall we make it 250 dollars ?,neutral
No . That price would hardly cover the cost .,sadness

"how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",neutral
that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?,neutral
that ' s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .,happiness
"thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",happiness
yep . Here it is . What do you think ?,neutral
that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?,happiness
the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?,neutral
"no , they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .",neutral
that ' s even better than the real thing .,neutral
"if I were you , I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .",neutral
it ' s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday !,sadness
"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?",happiness
Yes . Do you like it ?,happiness
It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .,happiness
Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .,surprise
Is classical music your favorite ?,happiness
Yes . What about you ?,happiness
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .,neutral
Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .,neutral
"Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .",neutral
Did you always like pop music .,neutral
"I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .",neutral
I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .,neutral
"oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .",surprise
"Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .",neutral

I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .,neutral
Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ' Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ' s too much information on the net .,happiness
"When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?",neutral
"Yes , I did . There ' s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ' m sure I haven ' t sent anything nasty to anyone .",neutral
"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .",neutral
"That ' s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .",happiness
That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time,neutral
How do I do that ?,neutral
"Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will",neutral
That ' s useful to know . Thanks . I ' ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .,happiness
Ah ! No ! Damn it !,anger
It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .,neutral
So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .,neutral
Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?,surprise
"No , I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .",neutral
"I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .",neutral
I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .,neutral
What are we going to do now ?,neutral
I don't know . I feel like going out .,neutral
I wonder how much of the city is down .,neutral
It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .,neutral
"Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed . And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .",neutral
"Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .",anger
"I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .",neutral
Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?,happiness
I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .,neutral
"Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?",neutral
"No , it just won't work . If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .",neutral
So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?,neutral
How many students are in the class ?,neutral
About fourteen .,neutral
"So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .",neutral
Damn !,anger
"Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ?",neutral
"Yes , here you go .",neutral
Will you be checking any bags today .,neutral
"Yes , I ' d like to check three pieces .",neutral
"I ' m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .",neutral
"What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ' m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ' absurd !",anger
"I am sorry , sir , there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big .",neutral
"Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this .",anger
Let ' s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars .,neutral
That ' s more than my round-trip ticket !,anger
"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?",happiness
"Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .",happiness
Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .,neutral
"That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .",happiness
Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .,happiness
"Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .",happiness
"They don't really think you took it , do they ?",neutral
I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .,disgust
How many of them were there ?,neutral
Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .,disgust
Like what ?,neutral
"Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .",disgust
What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?,neutral
"I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .",disgust
"Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years .",neutral
Hmm . Thank you very much .,neutral
Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !,happiness
"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",happiness
"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",happiness
"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",happiness
Me too .,happiness
"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",happiness
"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",happiness
"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .",happiness
"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",happiness
And the host announced that he won it all !,happiness
"Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ?",neutral
"Excuse me , sir . This is your passport .",neutral
Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ?,surprise
"Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass .",neutral
Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .,sadness
I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass .,neutral
But when does the plane take off ?,neutral
"Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir .",neutral
"Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) .",sadness
"Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion .",neutral
"( The speaker in the airport says , ' Mr . Benjamin , we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ?",neutral
Could be .,neutral
"Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back .",happiness

It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B .,neutral
"Thank you , thank you , thanks again .",happiness
Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?,neutral
Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?,neutral
"First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .",neutral
That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .,happiness
How do you research your books ?,happiness
I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .,happiness

Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .,happiness

"No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .",anger
Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .,sadness
So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .,anger
"I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .",sadness
"No , thank you .",anger

I thought they let you go .,neutral
"Yes , the next morning .",neutral
They made you spend the night at the station ?,neutral
"Yes , they did .",neutral
What was their reason for arresting you ?,neutral
I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for .,neutral

It's a souvenir I bought for you from Rome .,neutral
How beautiful ! I love it at all .,happiness
I'm glad you like it .,happiness
It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough .,happiness
Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did .,happiness
"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?",neutral
I don't want to .,anger
"Well , come over and talk to me then .",neutral
Certainly not .,anger
May I turn on the TV then ?,neutral
Turn on the TV for what ?,anger
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .,neutral
"Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?",anger
"I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .",neutral

In three months or so ?,neutral
You said the same thing three months ago .,anger
"Did I ? Well . Anyway , you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up .",neutral

You are welcome .,neutral
So can you fix it ?,neutral
I ' m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do .,sadness
What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !,surprise
"Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !",neutral
"OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?",neutral
"Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers .",neutral
I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ' s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !,neutral
"This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ' ll give you your money back !",anger
it ' s so great to be here ! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !,happiness
we ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?,happiness

Black .,neutral
I ' m sorry . We don't haven any .,sadness
But my sister bought this pair last month .,surprise
Did she buy them here ?,neutral
"No , she bought them in the U . S .",neutral
"We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now .",neutral
Can you get a pair for me please ?,neutral
I ' m afraid that I can ' t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ' re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now .,sadness
They look very uncomfortable .,neutral
They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !,neutral
Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .,neutral
Really ? Where did you hear that ?,surprise
"I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?",neutral
"I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .",neutral
"No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .",neutral
That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .,neutral
Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .,neutral
"Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .",neutral
"No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support .",sadness
"Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .",sadness
"Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ?",neutral
I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .,happiness
"Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason .",neutral
Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .,happiness
I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?,neutral
"Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that .",neutral
It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .,neutral
"Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?",neutral
"Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !",surprise
"Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne .",neutral
"Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .",surprise
It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .,neutral
"That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?",neutral
"No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft .",neutral
How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .,neutral
I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .,neutral
"Happy birthday , Jim !",happiness
"Thank you , Lisa .",happiness
Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .,happiness
"Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .",surprise
I'm very glad to hear that .,happiness
"Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .",neutral
What happened ? Why didn't he win ?,neutral
Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .,neutral
How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !,surprise
"If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .",neutral
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?,surprise
He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .,neutral
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .,disgust
They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .,disgust
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .,disgust
"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !",disgust
"Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .",neutral
"I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .",neutral
Let's hope so .,neutral
"Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .",surprise
You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .,neutral
Are you serious ? How can that be ?,neutral
"Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .",neutral
"Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .",neutral
That's true . But I just love it . Come here !,neutral
"Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !",happiness
You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .,happiness
"Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase .",happiness
"Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ?",happiness
"Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please .",neutral
What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .,neutral
Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .,neutral
Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .,neutral
"Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .",neutral
Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .,happiness
"Hey George , how is your chicken ?",neutral
"My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ?",neutral
My fish is pretty dry too .,sadness
It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh .,sadness
"Yes , it seems that way to me also .",neutral
How are your vegetables ?,neutral
My vegetables are very soggy .,neutral
Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .,sadness
"I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter .",neutral
I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food .,neutral
How do you want your hair cut ?,neutral

"First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .",neutral
"Oh , OK . Wow !",happiness
"OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .",neutral
Wow . That sounds really good .,happiness

Alright .,neutral
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,neutral
"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",surprise
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,anger
"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",neutral
It really hurts .,neutral
"Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",neutral
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,anger
"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",neutral
To hell with you .,anger
Look ! Allen has the mic !,surprise
I thought he only liked to listen !,neutral
"That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself !",surprise

"I don ' t think you do . If you did , I ' d have a car . See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .",anger
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .,neutral
Fine . I ' ll take the compact .,anger
"Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?",neutral

"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this .

"OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .",happiness

And that's when I started to notice him . Me too . Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . And the host announced that he won it all !",happiness

Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . Well , it's all new stock in the window now . May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for . There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .",happiness

I could have talked my way to thirty . is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?",anger

After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .",anger
