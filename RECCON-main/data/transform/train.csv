Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ?,happiness
How about Legally Blonde .,neutral
"Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ?",neutral
Isn't that a scary movie ?,neutral
"How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun .",neutral
Ok . I'll give it a try .,happiness
That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class .,happiness
Ok . See you tomorrow .,happiness
"Ann , it's terrible !",anger
What's up ?,neutral
"Look , this is a pimple !",neutral
"Oh , I think it is .",neutral
How come ?,neutral
I think it's because of your bad habits !,anger
"I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .",neutral
"I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .",neutral
I wasn't aware of that !,surprise
You should do better later .,neutral
What a great weekend that was !,happiness
My feelings exactly .,happiness
I really enjoy the beach in the summer .,happiness
I couldn't agree with you more .,happiness

"yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed !",disgust
why didn't you do a good job ?,neutral
"I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank .",neutral
do you think you studied enough for the exam ?,neutral
no ...,neutral
what did you do last night ?,neutral
I watched TV .,neutral
did you study at all last night for your exam ?,neutral

tomorrow .,neutral
alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare .,neutral
My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race .,surprise
"Excuse me , what did you say ?",surprise
A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games .,happiness
That's incredible . I can't believe it .,surprise
You have to . It is sure .,happiness
How amazing !,surprise
You look like a basket case .,neutral
I'm not surprised .,neutral
What's the problem ?,neutral
My brother in-law just dropped in from the states .,disgust
"Yeah , and ?",neutral
"I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake !",disgust
Why ?,neutral
"He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile .",disgust
I guess you think twice next time he comes .,neutral
You can say that again .,neutral
So how long has he here for ?,neutral
Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming .,neutral
"Well , I know you do the right thing .",neutral
What are you doing ?,neutral
What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ' t you know what day it is ?,neutral
Mumm . no .,neutral
It ' s only the day when the world ' s biggest sporting event is kicking off .,neutral
What ?,neutral
The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ' s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ' s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa,happiness
I have no idea what you ' re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl .,surprise
"This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g",neutral
"Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ' t really appeal to me .",neutral
"Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ' s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec",surprise
"All I know about soccer is that you can ' t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !",disgust
"Whatever , I ' m going to go watch the opening match .",neutral
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?,neutral
"yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ?",neutral
I was at home with my parents in New York City .,neutral
really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?,neutral
"I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .",neutral
that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?,neutral
"no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos .",neutral
did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?,neutral
"yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .",neutral
did he survive ?,neutral
"unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .",sadness
I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .,sadness
it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .,anger
terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .,neutral
Can I help you ?,neutral
"I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .",neutral
I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?,neutral
My paper is on the influence of television on children .,neutral
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .,neutral
Thank you for you help .,happiness
Have you seen that house ?,happiness
"Yes , it looks interesting .",happiness
You're right . I love it very much .,happiness
It must be old .,neutral
At least more than 100 years old .,neutral
Let's enter it !,neutral
I can't open the door .,neutral
It must be locked .,neutral
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .,neutral
She can't answer you .,neutral
She must be deaf .,neutral
It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?,neutral
Frightened ? You must be joking .,surprise
Where are you going this weekend ?,neutral
I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day .,neutral
So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ?,happiness
Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ?,happiness
"Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel .",happiness
Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ?,happiness
Your tent and enough food and water .,happiness
"You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ?",happiness
"We can go fishing , chatting and camping .",happiness
What are we waiting for ? Come on !,happiness
Don't hurry . Wait for my call .,happiness
"It's a fine day today , isn't it ?",happiness
"Yes , it is . It ' s wonderful after the downpour .",happiness
How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .,happiness
I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .,neutral
"Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .",neutral
You're right . We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .,neutral
Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .,surprise
The weatherman predicts a fine day today .,neutral
The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .,neutral
Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ?,neutral
No . What ?,neutral
He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail .,neutral
"No . Really , what happened ?",surprise
"Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk .",neutral
Was he out with the guys from the bank ?,neutral
"Yes , I think so .",neutral
"Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk .",neutral
"Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know .",neutral
"Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife .",surprise
"No , she left him last year .",neutral
"Oh , really ? Do you know why ?",surprise
"Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ?",neutral
He lost his wallet and keys .,neutral
"Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police .",neutral
"Oh , no .",neutral
"Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story",neutral
So then what happened ?,neutral
"Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out .",neutral
"Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation .",neutral
"Yes , I know .",neutral
Are you ready to go the concert ?,neutral
Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?,neutral
"Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .",happiness
"That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then .",happiness
Is your helmet comfortable ?,happiness
"Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .",happiness
Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .,happiness
I'll think about it .,happiness
Is that your new bicycle ?,happiness
"Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?",happiness
It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !,happiness
Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .,neutral
I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ?,neutral
"Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?",neutral
That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .,neutral
Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?,neutral
It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go .,neutral
"Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?",neutral
Cut what out I ' m not doing anything .,neutral
The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ' s driving me crazy .,anger
Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !,anger
"I don ' t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ' re shouting into your phone all the time ?",anger
You ' Ve got to be kidding me ! You ' re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?,anger
"Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .",neutral
Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .,neutral
"Yeah , I ' ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?",neutral
How's your thesis going ?,neutral
"Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done .",sadness
"I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing .",sadness
"Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me .",sadness
"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",fear
What is it ? What happened ?,neutral
I think someone is stalking me .,fear
"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",surprise
"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",fear
What did you do ?,neutral
"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",fear
Did he leave when you left ?,neutral
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,neutral
He followed me all the way home !,fear
That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .,neutral
"Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?",fear
"Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .",neutral
Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !,fear
Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .,neutral
I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .,neutral
"Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out . If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police . But for now , just try not to worry .",neutral
Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .,neutral
"Jim , I heard you ' Ve bought a new computer .",happiness
"Yes . Look , it is on my desk .",happiness
"Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ?",happiness
Not at all . It ' s a piece of cake .,neutral
A piece of cake ?,surprise
Yes . It ' s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it .,happiness
Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ?,neutral
I would love to help you prepare for your presentation .,happiness
I hate to ask you to do something like that .,neutral
This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that .,happiness
When could we get together ?,neutral
I could easily give you some time tomorrow night .,neutral
Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ?,happiness
"Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ?",happiness
I'll come prepared .,happiness
Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet .,happiness
"So , Emily , how was your day ?",neutral
I don't think you really want to hear about it .,sadness
It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .,neutral
"To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !",disgust
Why ? What happened ?,neutral
"Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !",anger
That's not very fair . What did you do ?,neutral
"There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure .",disgust
Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?,neutral
"He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !",anger
Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?,neutral
I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !,anger
Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?,neutral
Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .,neutral
That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders .,neutral
"I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .",neutral
"That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .",neutral
Then I'll take them . How much ?,happiness
$ 120 . The small gift box is complementary .,happiness
Here is $ 150 . Keep the change .,happiness
Thank you ! Have a nice day !,happiness
You too . Bye .,happiness
"Hello , Helen .",neutral
"Hi , Steven .",neutral
How are you today ?,neutral
"I ' m very well , Thank you . And you ?",happiness
"I ' m fine , thanks . How is Tony ?",happiness
"He ' s fine , Thanks . How ' s Emma ?",happiness
"She ' s very well , too , Helen . Goodbye , Helen . Nice to see you .",happiness
"Nice to see you , too , Steven . Goodbye .",happiness
I have an idea for Christmas this year .,neutral
What is it ?,neutral
Let's not exchange any gifts at all .,happiness
You big scrooge !,happiness
Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !,happiness
But you may have some trouble convincing the kids .,neutral
"Actual 1y , it was their idea first .",neutral
Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas .,happiness
"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ?",happiness
"To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here .",happiness
"The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else .",happiness
"Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?",happiness
"Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game .",neutral
Who plays who ?,neutral
"Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .",neutral
It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?,neutral
In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .,neutral
I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .,neutral
"Oh , you know something . He is 2 . 26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .",neutral
I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .,neutral
"Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .",neutral
"That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy .",neutral
"Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ?",neutral
You are always so naughty .,neutral
"Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker !",happiness
"Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ?",happiness
I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ?,happiness
"Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ?",happiness
That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ?,happiness
I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division .,happiness
What should I get Uncle Teddy ?,neutral
You could get him a tie .,neutral
Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .,surprise
Why not ?,neutral
Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .,neutral
"Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .",neutral
That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise . But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .,happiness
"He would think you were crazy , Caroline .",neutral
"Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .",neutral
How much do you want to spend ?,neutral
"Well , he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .",neutral
"Alright , I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .",neutral
Yes .,neutral
"Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .",neutral
What should he have then ?,neutral
"I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .",neutral
I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?,happiness
I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .,neutral
Alright . We can go later then .,neutral
"We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .",neutral
Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?,happiness
She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .,neutral
Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them . And what about Dad ?,neutral
How about the iguana ?,neutral
I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .,neutral
A tie ?,neutral
"Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ?",anger
I was just kidding .,neutral
I decided to give it a go !,happiness
Good for you . What items did you bid on ?,happiness
A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !,happiness
Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !,happiness
Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty !,happiness
That's not how this game works .,neutral
"Well , there was a sign that said "" Buy now for seventy . """,neutral
How many bids had been placed before you ?,neutral
I hear you are moving to Dalian .,happiness
Yes . I found a very good job down here .,happiness
"Well , we'll certainly miss you here .",happiness
"I am going to miss you , too .",happiness
Let's keep in touch .,happiness
OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there .,happiness
I think your speech was excellent .,happiness
Was it ?,neutral
Sure it was .,happiness
"Thank you . It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know .",happiness
But you did it and did it well !,happiness
"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",anger
What ? What did you buy ?,neutral
It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,anger
What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,neutral
"There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .",neutral
And ?,neutral
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,neutral
And it's a brick ?,neutral
I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,surprise
"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",neutral
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,neutral
"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",neutral
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,surprise
He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,neutral
"Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",neutral
"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",neutral
That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,neutral
"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?",neutral
"Wow , the view from the peak is so grand !",happiness
"Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red .",happiness
Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?,neutral
"Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child .",neutral
But my father did not . He didn't have much time .,neutral
"Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent .",happiness
Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?,surprise
"Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time .",neutral
It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?,neutral
Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty .,neutral
Can I see the rainbow ?,neutral
"That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks .",neutral
"Why don ' t you sit down and relax , darling ?",neutral
I don ' t want to .,anger
"Well , come and talk to me then .",neutral
Certainly not .,anger
May I turn on the radio then ?,neutral
Turn on the radio ? What for ?,anger
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .,neutral
Listen to some music ? And who ' ll cook dinner ? Will you ?,anger
"Ok , I will . But let ' s go to a disco after dinner .",neutral
"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .",anger
Have you been to Shanghai before ?,neutral
Yes I have . I ' Ve been there three times in the past year .,happiness
That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ?,happiness
No I haven ' t . I haven ' t visited the Bund either . I ' Ve always had too much work to do .,happiness
"So you haven ' t done much then , in Shanghai ?",neutral
"Actually , I ' Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious !",happiness
"What do you do in your free time , Nancy ?",neutral
"Well , I like playing the violin .",neutral
Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ?,neutral
About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school .,neutral
That's really interesting .,happiness
Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?,happiness
"Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though .",happiness
Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby .,happiness
"I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor .",happiness
"That's all tight , Mr . Smith . That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon .",happiness
I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks .,happiness
"No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks .",happiness
I will . It's most thoughtful of you .,happiness
What's in the box ?,neutral
"Sandy , I think we made a mistake ...",neutral
What do you mean ?,neutral
It's a cute little teddy bear !,happiness
How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !,happiness
And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card .,surprise
Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone !,happiness
"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?",neutral
"It ' s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ' t wear perfume .",neutral
I ' m sorry . I didn ' t know that .,neutral
That ' s all right . Thank you all the same .,happiness
"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .",neutral
"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?",neutral
"There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .",neutral
I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .,sadness
What about sunday ?,neutral
"I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday .",neutral
Maybe next week .,neutral
"Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .",neutral
"Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .",sadness
"I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .",sadness
I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods .,neutral
"Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ?",surprise
I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that .,neutral
My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ?,surprise
Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ?,neutral
What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now .,sadness
But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?,neutral
"It seems that I have nothing to do , except this .",sadness
Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss .,neutral
It ' s very kind of you to invite me to dinner .,happiness
Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ' t stand on ceremony .,happiness
This dish is really delicious .,happiness
I ' m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it .,happiness
You ' re great . Could you say it in Chinese ?,happiness
"Sure , we call it doubt .",happiness
"Welcome , Ron , come on in !",happiness

Put on a sweater ! I ' m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ' s a bit chilly .,anger
Dad ! I ' m gonna catch a cold !,anger

"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous , so everyone loves them .",neutral
I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .,neutral
"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ?",neutral
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .,neutral
"No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ' t even pay for Drin",anger
"Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea",neutral
"I don ' t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ' re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored .",anger
I think you should give them some credit . They ' re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves,neutral
Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .,anger
I think that ' s settled .,neutral
I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !,anger
How dare you speak to me like this .,anger

Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ?,neutral
Steven ! What ' s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ' t know you have a gun ! What ' s going on !,fear

What ? Why didn ' t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ?,surprise
"When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau .",neutral
"What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me !",anger
"I ' m sorry , I wasn ' t supposed to meet you . I wasn ' t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real .",neutral
I can ' t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ' t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car !,anger
"Veronica , wait !",neutral

Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ?,neutral
"Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .",happiness
Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .,happiness
"Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .",happiness
That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes .,happiness
"When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her .",happiness
It seems you two bring out the best of one another .,happiness
Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .,happiness
"Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other .",happiness
"Thanks , I think so too .",happiness
"Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night !",happiness
You mean with my performance ?,happiness
"Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type .",happiness
I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve .,neutral
Where did you learn to sing like that ?,neutral
I was part of a band in school .,neutral
You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ?,surprise
Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ?,neutral
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .,happiness
It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .,happiness
Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .,happiness
Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY !,anger

It's so small that I didn't notice it .,neutral
What were you screaming at me for ?,neutral
"Hi , Becky , what's up ?",neutral
"Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .",neutral
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .,neutral
For example ?,neutral
"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .",neutral
"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .",neutral
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .,neutral
"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .",neutral
You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?,neutral
"We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .",neutral
That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .,happiness
Do you like traveling ?,neutral
"Yes , I've just come back from Scotland .",neutral
Where did you visit ?,neutral
I only had time to visit Edinburgh .,neutral
How did you like it ?,neutral

You must have enjoyed yourself .,happiness
"Yes , and I took many pictures .",happiness
It smells like an ashtray in here !,anger
Hi honey ! What ' s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?,neutral
What ' s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .,anger
No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ' t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !,neutral
"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ' s not like you can just light up like before .",anger
"I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ' t have the willpower to just quit . I can ' t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?",neutral
Fine ! I want a divorce !,anger
"If ever you ' re in Chicago , please do look me up .",happiness
"Well , yes , I ' d like to , if it ' s not too much trouble .",happiness
No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well .,happiness
That ' d be fine .,happiness

"Don ' t you worry , I ' ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ' s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you !",happiness
Um ... no .,neutral
"Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece !",happiness

What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?,neutral
She looked sweeter than her pictures .,neutral
Did you take a photo with her ?,neutral

Crazy !,surprise
What ? What did you buy ?,surprise
"There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .",anger

I understand . But really you weren't rude at all . You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .,neutral
"But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that .",neutral

He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .,anger
I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .,neutral
"I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .",anger
Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss .,neutral
"Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .",neutral
"Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .",neutral
I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?,neutral
I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .,neutral

"What ' s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ' t people do something to stop it ?",disgust
"It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?",neutral

"I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's",happiness
They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .,neutral
That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?,happiness
"Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go",neutral

"Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too .",neutral
That does sound a lot of fun .,happiness
"I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks .",neutral
"Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that .",neutral
"Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .",happiness
Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .,happiness
"Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .",happiness

I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?,neutral
It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .,neutral
Why does he want to do that ?,neutral
"Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .",neutral
Won ' t they get his inheritance ?,neutral
"No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .",neutral
I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .,happiness
"So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?",neutral

I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .,happiness
Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .,neutral
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?,neutral
What ? Why do we have to do that ?,surprise
"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .",neutral
"I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",anger
"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !",neutral
"That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !",surprise

Yes . And what dances do you like best ?,happiness
"Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing .",happiness
"Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .",happiness

The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you .,happiness
But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body .,neutral
"Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed !",happiness
"It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters .",happiness
What do you mean by that ?,neutral
"Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions .",happiness
You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything .,neutral
"Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?",neutral
I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .,neutral
"Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?",happiness
That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .,happiness
"I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .",happiness
And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .,happiness
"Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .",happiness
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !,happiness
"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",happiness
"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",neutral
"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",neutral
Me too .,neutral
"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",neutral
"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",neutral
"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .",happiness
"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",neutral
And the host announced that he won it all !,happiness
"Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside .",neutral
"Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .",neutral
"Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .",neutral
"Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much .",happiness
"My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before .",happiness
"Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town !",neutral
"Well , thanks for the suggestions .",happiness

"Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes .",neutral
When can you do that ?,neutral
"Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?",neutral
Sure . What can you choose from ?,neutral
"Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .",neutral
What is your major ?,neutral
"I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ' ll see .",neutral
What are the fundamental course ?,neutral
"In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art .",neutral
Interesting . That ' s very different from the Chinese education system .,neutral
"Yes , it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .",neutral
"oh , sure . In British , students don ' t have to take the foundation course .",neutral
why not ?,neutral
maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .,happiness
It was great meeting you .,happiness
Me too .,happiness
Maybe we can meet again sometime ?,happiness
"Of course , but I'll have to go now .",happiness
I ' Ve had it ! I ' m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !,anger
So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?,neutral

Have you ever written up a business plan before ?,neutral
"Well , no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?",anger
"You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .",neutral
"Well , that seems easy enough .",neutral
"Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .",neutral
Geez . Is that all ?,neutral
"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !",neutral
Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !,happiness
I've enjoyed conversing with you .,neutral
Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ?,anger
I've got to go .,neutral
I wasn't done talking to you .,anger
"I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey .",anger
I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking .,neutral
I really don't think it's any of your business .,anger
That's not nice .,anger
"I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now .",neutral
Okay .,neutral
Who's that tall guy over there ?,neutral
"Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk .",neutral
What's he like normally ?,neutral
"Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems .",neutral
Really ? What kind of problems ?,surprise
"Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well .",neutral
"Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised .",neutral
Really ? What makes you say that ?,surprise
"Well , he doesn't look very honest .",neutral
"I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ?",neutral
"Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them .",neutral
"Oh , really ?",neutral
"Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ?",happiness
"Yes , I'll have another cocktail .",happiness

OK . I'll wait here for you .,happiness
"How do you like your job here , Linda ?",neutral
"It's interesting , I like being an editor .",happiness
"I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people .",happiness
"I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring .",happiness
I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry .,happiness
Do you have any complaints ?,neutral
"No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?",neutral
"Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .",happiness
That's perfect . I will definitely do well .,happiness
"Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on .",happiness
"Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said .",happiness
"Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .",happiness
I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .,happiness
"No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?",happiness
I got it on sale down at the department store .,neutral
When did you go there ?,neutral
"I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .",neutral
I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ?,neutral
Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles .,neutral
I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .,neutral
That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated .,neutral
"Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties .",neutral
"Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?",neutral
"Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?",neutral
I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .,neutral
Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans .,neutral
I guess that you will really be dressing down .,neutral
That's my style when I'm not in the office .,neutral
Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .,happiness
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !,happiness
There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ?,happiness
Vanilla with toppings is my favorite .,happiness
Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?,neutral
No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?,neutral
I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .,neutral
"I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me .",neutral
I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .,neutral
I think that would be horrible !,disgust
I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !,happiness
"Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ?",neutral
There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it .,sadness
Why ? We can leave school earlier that day .,neutral
"I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up .",sadness
I can't believe it . My parents never beat me .,surprise
You know that my father is irritable .,sadness
You can ask the teacher for help .,neutral
Good idea .,neutral

"Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it .",neutral
It's excellent .,happiness
Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it .,neutral
It's delicious .,happiness
What sort of western food do you like best ?,neutral
I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?,neutral
I find the Chinese dishes wonderful .,happiness

It's still early .,neutral

Whatever you prefer .,neutral
This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?,happiness
Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?,neutral

Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well .,neutral
That's too bad . They ' re such good company .,sadness
I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that .,neutral
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .,surprise
"Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet .",neutral
Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .,neutral
"That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .",neutral
What do you know ? You are over weight too .,neutral
I'm not on a diet though .,neutral
"I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .",neutral
I like ice cream too much though .,neutral
C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .,neutral
It does sound appealing .,neutral
It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .,happiness
Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .,happiness
Great . I'll get our plan started right away .,happiness

You ' re making my blood boil .,anger
Calm down . Madam .,neutral

"Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window .",fear
What ' s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ?,neutral
"Paranoid ? I ' m not paranoid ! I ' m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis .",fear
"OK , well , what did you want to see me about ?",neutral
You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful !,fear

Just watching some TV .,neutral

Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ?,neutral
It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?,neutral
You wanna shoot some hoops ?,neutral
"I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy .",neutral
Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today .,neutral
She's out shopping with her friends .,neutral

"Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too",neutral
Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ?,neutral
"Because I'm the wrong sex , of course !",anger
You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ?,neutral
"Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair .",anger
What sort of clothes does he wear ?,neutral
A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ?,neutral
Perhaps that had something to do with it .,neutral

"It's possible , isn't it ?",neutral
Do you really think I should wear different clothes ?,neutral

Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company .,neutral
Welcome back ! How was your vacation ?,happiness
"It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !",happiness
Where did you end up going ?,happiness
"Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there .",happiness
I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?,happiness
That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?,happiness
Sure . What's this one a picture of ?,neutral
"Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .",neutral
You don't look very happy in that picture .,neutral
"No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !",neutral
So what did you do ?,neutral
"We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .",happiness
My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?,happiness
Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .,happiness
That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .,happiness
Your search on this project has been excellent .,happiness

Yes .,happiness
I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !,neutral
Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake .,neutral
"It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .",neutral
"But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .",neutral
"That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .",neutral
Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?,neutral
I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .,neutral
"Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?",neutral
Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .,neutral
"Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .",happiness
That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .,happiness
"If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .",happiness
I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !,happiness
"Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again .",happiness
Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day .,happiness

"not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black .",happiness
The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .,neutral

Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .,happiness
Let's hope it is !,happiness

"You ' re missing the point . It ' s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ' s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words .",disgust

"Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed .",happiness
"It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say .",happiness
Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her .,happiness
Most women follow fashion like sheep . They don't know any better than imitate .,disgust
I quite agree with you . See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !,disgust
"The gown is quite expensive , believe me .",happiness
So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .,disgust
You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .,happiness
"You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .",happiness
Thanks . I'm flattered .,happiness
"Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while .",disgust
did you get my email ?,neutral
I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?,neutral
sure .,neutral
how did the business trip go ?,neutral
"well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .",disgust
"I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !",neutral
I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !,neutral
our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .,neutral
"I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me .",disgust
I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .,happiness
thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !,happiness
no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?,happiness
"no , should I have ?",neutral
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .,neutral
My father failed in business .,sadness
"Oh , that's really tough .",neutral
Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .,sadness
"I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?",neutral
"No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties .",sadness
"Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .",neutral
"Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?",neutral
Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?,neutral
"Oh , it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?",neutral
"Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .",neutral
Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !,happiness
"Yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .",neutral
That ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?,neutral
Of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .,neutral
"You mean you got working experience , right ?",neutral
Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .,neutral
It must be very demanding .,neutral
"Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ' s easy to figure out .",neutral
Really ? It sounds interesting .,surprise
Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .,happiness
Great . I ' m looking forward to it .,happiness
"Good morning , Mary !",happiness
"Good morning , John !",happiness
I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?,happiness
"I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ?",happiness
"Yes , if that's all right for you .",happiness
"I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ?",happiness
"Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .",happiness
That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven .,happiness
It's snowing outside .,happiness
"Oh , how could it be ?",surprise
Let's go out and have a look .,happiness
OK . Wait a minute .,happiness
"Look at the snow , it's so beautiful .",happiness
Yes . It's really snowing .,happiness
"I love winter , I love snow .",happiness
But don't you think it's a little too cold ?,neutral
But I like cold more than hot .,neutral
You are so interesting .,happiness
Did you bring some lunch with you ?,neutral
"Yes , I packed it myself .",happiness
"Wow , that looks beautiful .",happiness
"It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty .",happiness
I might try it myself .,happiness
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?,happiness
Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?,happiness
"I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .",happiness
That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?,happiness
"I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .",happiness
"If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?",happiness
"I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .",happiness
You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .,happiness
"The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .",happiness
The Taj it is then .,happiness
Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?,happiness
They'll still charge us a corkage fee .,happiness
That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .,happiness
Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .,happiness
Are you sure ? We could go Dutch .,surprise
"No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .",happiness
I won't argue with that ! Let's go !,happiness
Are you going to the party on Saturday ?,neutral
I was thinking about it . Are you ?,neutral

Everyone from school .,neutral
How do you know it's going to be so fun ?,neutral
"This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks .",happiness
"Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun .",happiness
So am I going to see you at the party ?,happiness
"Yeah , I will be there .",happiness
"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?",neutral
"I ' m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !",happiness
What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?,neutral
"It ' s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ' m an Aries . When were you born ?",neutral
January 5th .,neutral
"Let ' s see . . . you ' re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ' ll both have interesting summers !",happiness
"That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .",neutral
"No , it ' s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .",neutral
"Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?",neutral
A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !,happiness
You ' re all set now ?,happiness
"Oh , thank you so much .",happiness
"Really , it was nothing .",happiness
I really appreciated it .,happiness
I was happy to help .,happiness
It was so kind of you .,happiness
Don ' t mention it .,happiness
You ' re a real friend in need .,happiness

We went to Europe .,neutral
What cities did you go to ?,neutral
"London , Paris and a few other cities .",neutral
Did you go to Berlin ?,neutral
"No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time .",neutral
I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .,happiness
That's what I've heard .,happiness
"I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city .",happiness
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?,happiness
It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .,happiness
"Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?",happiness
Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...,happiness
Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .,happiness
You're dancing so well .,happiness
You dance beautifully too .,happiness
When did you learn to dance ?,happiness
In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?,happiness
It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .,happiness
How about tango ?,happiness
"Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?",happiness
Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ),happiness
Thank you for the dance .,happiness
What do you think ?,neutral
It looks great .,happiness
I would like to purchase it .,happiness

I appreciate what you have done for me . Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you .,happiness
We are ready to help you .,happiness
"Will you be kind to say "" Thank you "" to Mr . Zhang and other friends for me ?",happiness
I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us . Welcome to China again .,happiness
"Of course , I will . Well , it's time for me to say goodbye . The plane will take off soon . Hope some day you will come to America for a visit .",happiness
Thank you . I will if I have chance . Goodbye and happy landing !,happiness
Goodbye !,happiness
"What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .",happiness
I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble .,happiness
"No , I shouldn't think so . By the way , is there a socket for my razor ?",happiness
I think so . Here it is . It ' s by the basin .,neutral
Is it a two-pin socket ?,neutral
"Yes , it is .",neutral
"Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug .",happiness
It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck .,happiness
I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .,happiness
"Yes , goodbye and keep in touch .",happiness
"Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?",neutral
"Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?",neutral
I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?,neutral
"Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .",happiness
"I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?",neutral
"A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .",neutral
You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .,surprise
"Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .",neutral
"Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?",happiness
"Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you .",neutral
"8 pm , that's fine with me .",neutral
So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .,neutral
"Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night .",neutral
"Ok , George . Bye !",neutral
"Bye , Ann !",neutral
I'd like to meet you again sometime .,happiness

My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .,sadness
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?,sadness
"Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .",neutral
You need a babysitter .,neutral
"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .",neutral
I could have Suzy stay at my place .,neutral
"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",neutral
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,neutral
"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",neutral
"I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .",neutral
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .,neutral
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .,happiness
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .,neutral
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .,happiness
"Hi , Sara , what are you reading ?",neutral
"Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter .",neutral

"Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle .",happiness
"Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want .",surprise
"Please go ahead , I am listening .",happiness
I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .,neutral
Is your back door higher than the ground level ?,neutral
"Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground .",neutral
"Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail .",neutral
I don't like things to be fancy .,neutral
Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look .,happiness
"Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?",happiness
Cedar is a good choice .,happiness
"Well , let's take the measurements right now .",happiness
Oh that ' s a lovely necklace .,happiness
Thank you . My husband gave it to me .,happiness
Oh I didn ' t know you were married .,happiness
Yes I am . I got married five years ago .,happiness
Oh I see . That ' s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ?,neutral
"No , we met at university .",neutral
"Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ?",neutral
I didn't have any big plans .,neutral

How long have you been studying English ?,neutral
More than six years .,neutral
That's a long time .,neutral
"Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school .",neutral
No wonder your English is so good .,happiness
"Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice .",happiness
I see . Talking with other people is very important .,happiness
"Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet .",happiness
I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come .,happiness
Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come .,happiness
"Hey , that ' s a very nice hairdo you ' re wearing !",happiness
Oh you ' re exaggerating . I ' m never really good at making hairdo .,happiness
"You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good !",surprise
"Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise .",happiness
He ' s just got no idea of how good you are .,happiness
Did you enjoy that new movie ?,neutral

"What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .",surprise
"Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ?",neutral
Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ?,neutral
His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .,sadness
I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .,neutral
I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .,sadness
Doesn't sound promising .,neutral
"Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug .",sadness
If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .,neutral
"Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class .",happiness
What are you doing this weekend ?,neutral
I am not sure . What are you doing ?,neutral
I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach .,happiness
That sounds like a great idea !,happiness
Would you be interested in joining me ?,happiness
"Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ?",happiness
I thought that we could leave around 8,happiness
That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ?,happiness
That was part of my plan .,happiness
"Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you .",happiness
"How are you feeling , John ?",neutral
"Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed .",neutral
Do more exercises after you are healthy .,happiness
"Ok , I will . You have said that many times .",happiness

What style do you want ?,neutral
Can you make my hair short ?,happiness
Exactly how short do you want it ?,neutral
Make it a few inches long .,happiness
Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ?,neutral
I've been thinking about this for a while now .,happiness
Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want .,neutral
I honestly want my hair that short .,happiness
"All right , then let's begin .",neutral
"I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking .",anger
It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ?,neutral
It ' s simply because the tins were damaged .,anger
"It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way .",neutral
"I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling .",anger
Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ?,neutral
"Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us .",neutral
Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably .,neutral
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !,anger
Why ? What are they like ?,neutral
They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !,anger
Have you ever talked to them about it ?,neutral
"I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !",anger
What did they say ?,neutral
They both just talk about how great they are all the time .,anger
They soud like the neighbours from hell !,anger
"They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .",anger
I thought you didn't talk to them much .,neutral
"I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .",neutral
What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?,neutral
Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .,neutral
Maybe you should think about moving .,neutral
I can't afford to move right now .,disgust
"Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .",neutral
"I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .",disgust
"Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ?",neutral
I don ' t think I can take another semester of this dorm food .,disgust
"I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired .",disgust
"Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself .",disgust
Have you found anything yet ?,neutral
You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?,neutral
"You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school .",neutral
"I got a car , so the distance wouldn ' t really be a problem .",neutral
But the parking might be .,neutral
You bet !,neutral
"Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day .",neutral

"Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in .",happiness
"Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park .",happiness
"It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it .",happiness

"to be honest , I'm a bit fed up .",anger
what's wrong ?,neutral
"well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .",anger
that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it .,neutral
"the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't .",anger
I see how that can get a bit annoying .,neutral
a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar .,anger
so what are you going to do about it ?,neutral
"I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him .",neutral
what do you think would make you happier ?,neutral
"in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .",neutral
relationships can be confusing sometimes .,neutral
what would you do if you were me ?,neutral
I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him !,neutral

Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky .,happiness
Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture .,happiness
Yes . Will it hurt us ?,happiness
I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .,happiness
OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .,happiness
"I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know .",happiness
"You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree .",happiness
"Well , it is a birch tree . It is not as old as you think .",happiness
How do you know ?,neutral
Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree .,happiness

I locked it when I left though .,neutral
"Yes , but the robber broke in . Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked .",neutral

"Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .",happiness
"Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .",neutral
"Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?",neutral

"How awful , poor guy .",neutral

I am glad you can study something you really like !,happiness
"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator .",happiness
"Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ' t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works .",happiness
I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice .,happiness
"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ' s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .",happiness
Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .,neutral
"Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .",neutral

"They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors .",happiness
I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything .,happiness
Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people .,happiness
"To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not .",happiness
You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .,happiness

Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !,happiness
"Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .",neutral
Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !,happiness
"I know . I can see that . This is what is called "" dim sum , "" right ?",neutral
"Yes , all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes . You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .",neutral
"So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?",neutral
Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .,happiness
"And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .",neutral
No way !,neutral
"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .",neutral
"Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?",neutral
"No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown .",neutral
Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?,neutral
"No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .",neutral
I wonder if you can cook things this good .,happiness
I'm a great cook actually . You will see .,happiness
"Well , how was your honeymoon ?",neutral
"It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing .",happiness
Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !,happiness
"Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ?",happiness
My friends and I just got back from Bali .,happiness
"Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ?",happiness
"Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free .",happiness
Did you go diving while you were there ?,neutral
"I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead !",neutral
Did you take any pictures in the ocean ?,neutral
I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you .,happiness
Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?,happiness
We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ?,happiness
"No , but I do like snowboarding .",happiness
Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?,happiness
I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !,happiness
It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount .,happiness
What's up ? You look low .,neutral
It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game .,sadness
I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again .,sadness
I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart .,neutral
Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves .,sadness
"Hey , Daniel , how's it going ?",neutral
"Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .",happiness
"Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?",surprise
We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .,neutral
Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?,neutral
"Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .",neutral
"Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?",neutral
"Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty .",neutral
"Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?",neutral
"Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do .",neutral
"You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .",neutral
"OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .",happiness
"That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?",happiness
"Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?",happiness
"Exactly , now , tell me the time .",happiness
"I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you .",neutral
"Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company .",happiness
"Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it .",happiness
"You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?",happiness
"Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions .",happiness
"Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something .",happiness
"Come on , don ' t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ' t get this turned around without the support from you people .",happiness
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from !,happiness
"Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ?",happiness
I love fruit flavored ices the best .,happiness
"I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever .",happiness
What is your least favorite ice cream ?,neutral
I don't like peppermint ice cream .,neutral
"Yeah , I know what you mean .",neutral
"One time , I tried garlic ice cream .",neutral
That could be interesting .,neutral
That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order !,neutral
How do you feel about this restaurant ?,neutral
I really liked it !,happiness
I really enjoyed the food .,happiness
What did you enjoy the most ?,neutral
I enjoyed the fish the most .,neutral
"The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert .",happiness
The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world !,happiness
I really felt that the service was exceptionally good .,happiness
"Yes , the service really added to the experience .",happiness
I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant .,happiness
Does it look like a good fit ?,neutral
It's definitely your size .,happiness
"Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it .",happiness
How do you prefer to pay ?,neutral
Let me use my credit card .,neutral
"Now , if you'll just sign here .",neutral
I hope you enjoy your purchase . Good-bye .,happiness
Perfect . Couldn ' t be better !,happiness
"Come on , you must tell me everything about him .",neutral
"Well , he's very tall and handsome .",happiness
Hmm ...,neutral
He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .,happiness
"Oh , how long ?",neutral
"Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold .",happiness
OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does .,neutral
He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well .,happiness
"He's quite a patient teacher , too .",happiness
Fine .,neutral
You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy .,happiness
I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 .,sadness
Don't worry about that .,neutral
Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble .,sadness
No trouble at all .,neutral
Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ?,neutral
"No , that's quite out of the question .",neutral
Please accept my deep apology .,sadness
I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it .,neutral
"Good afternoon , Sam .",happiness
"Good afternoon , Tina .",happiness
What are you going to do tomorrow ?,neutral
I'm not sure yet . And you ?,neutral
I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ?,neutral
Is skating interesting ?,neutral
"I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable .",neutral
But I can't skate well .,neutral
"It doesn't matter , I can teach you .",happiness
It's very kind of you .,happiness
I really appreciate your driving me around .,happiness
"It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .",happiness
It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .,neutral
So what do you see in there ?,neutral
This one sounds good . Efficiency with view of the lake . Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .,neutral
Can you afford that much ?,neutral
"No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .",neutral
"Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment . Usually one large room and a small bathroom . There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .",neutral
How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?,neutral
That means the apartment has furniture in it .,neutral
That's good .,happiness
"Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .",neutral
Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .,neutral
It's still pretty expensive .,neutral
"Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .",neutral
Alright . What's the phone number ?,neutral
256-7797 .,neutral
Got it . What else do you see ?,neutral
This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate . Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment . Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?,neutral
"No . It probably means they have a large apartment . Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms . They need someone for the empty bedroom .",neutral
That sounds alright .,happiness
"Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all . If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .",neutral
"Here's the number , 256-4367 .",neutral
Got it . Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .,neutral
Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .,happiness
"Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ?",happiness
"Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ?",neutral
I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ?,neutral
Would you like to play tennis with me ?,happiness
I'd like to .,happiness
Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning .,happiness
"OK , will do !",happiness
What a nice day !,happiness
Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?,happiness
"Great , let's go !",neutral
"Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .",happiness
"Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...",happiness
"Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !",neutral
"Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .",happiness
Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ?,neutral
"Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?",neutral
"Yeah , I think so .",neutral
Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .,happiness
Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .,happiness
I ' m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ?,happiness
Sure . Let ' s go . What are you going to have done ?,happiness
I want to have a foot massage and haircut .,happiness
A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ' d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ' s supposed to help with your complexion .,happiness
Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures .,happiness
This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !,happiness
I think it ' s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ' t you agree ?,happiness
"Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .",neutral
Maybe we should try a thai massage too .,neutral
What ' s special about a thai massage ?,neutral
That ' s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet .,neutral
Sounds painful !,neutral
Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly .,happiness
Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice !,happiness
Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ?,happiness
"Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song .",happiness
How about this one ?,neutral
"Sorry , I can't sing the song .",neutral
Er ... How about this one ?,neutral
OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part .,neutral
Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part .,neutral
Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ?,neutral
My grandmother just passed away .,sadness
I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ?,neutral
A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral .,sadness
Is there anything I can do ?,neutral
No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time .,sadness
I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ?,neutral
Yeah . She died in her sleep .,neutral
I'm sorry she's gone .,neutral
At least she didn't suffer .,neutral
I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .,neutral
I know . But I miss her .,neutral
"When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said .",neutral
Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks .,happiness
It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat .,neutral
You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go .,happiness
"Of course , I like flowers .",happiness
"I like peach blossom , because I like spring .",happiness
Peach blossom is really beautiful .,happiness
I like lotus .,happiness
But there aren't any lotus now .,happiness
Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms .,happiness
That's not bad . Let's go .,happiness
"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .",happiness
Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?,surprise
"Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .",happiness
Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !,happiness
What other activities will you have tomorrow ?,neutral
"Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .",neutral
Do you bring some gifts along ?,neutral
"That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand .",neutral
Is it the same practice for all families ?,neutral
"Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .",neutral
I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .,neutral
"Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days .",neutral
What a hot day !,neutral
"Yes , summer is coming .",neutral
Where are you going this summer vacation ?,neutral
I'd like to go to Tianjin .,neutral
Do you want to go to the beach there ?,happiness
"Yes , of course . And what's your plan ?",happiness
The same to you .,happiness
Do you take a bus to and from work ?,neutral
"Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .",neutral
"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .",neutral
"Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .",disgust
"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .",disgust
What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?,neutral
"You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !",anger
"Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?",neutral
"Yeah , absolutely !",neutral
"And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .",neutral
"You were so happy , weren ' t you ?",neutral
What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .,neutral
Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China .,happiness
"Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .",happiness
That must be very beautiful .,happiness
"Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies .",happiness
Really ? Have you ever been there ?,happiness
A couple of times .,happiness
Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me .,happiness
Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide .,happiness
Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .,happiness
"Tomorrow , I ' ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect .",happiness
Just make sure children don ' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .,neutral
There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month .,happiness
What kind of food will they be serving ?,neutral
"My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo .",happiness
It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .,happiness
I can hardly wait !,happiness
Do you know the day they plan to open ?,neutral
I'll double check the announcement .,neutral
Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ?,neutral
"You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ?",happiness
"Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .",happiness
"Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .",happiness
Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .,happiness
"Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?",happiness
"Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future .",happiness
What does he look like ? Can people tell ?,happiness
"Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .",happiness
"Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces .",neutral
"How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose . This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw .",neutral
Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool .,happiness
They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?,happiness
"That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different .",neutral
Janet Jackson is more pop music . Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes .,neutral
Have you heard Maria Carey ?,neutral
"Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like .",happiness
Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one .,happiness
I hope you have a good stereo .,neutral
Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .,neutral
The time has come to say goodbye .,sadness
So soon . It seems as if you just got here .,sadness
"I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say .",sadness
It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .,happiness
I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .,happiness
"It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine .",happiness
"You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ?",happiness
"Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring .",happiness
I'll be expecting you then .,happiness
You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ?,happiness
"In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go .",happiness
"Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone .",neutral
"You are not going to give it up , are you ?",neutral
"No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either .",neutral
I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .,neutral
"Yes , but whom to ?",neutral
"Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .",happiness
"That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees .",happiness
"Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then .",happiness
"Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .",happiness
"Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .",happiness
"Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ' m allowed to repair cars for a living .",happiness
That ' s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .,happiness
I guess I never thought of that before .,happiness
"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .",happiness
"Wow , you ' Ve inspired me to do something !",happiness
"Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .",neutral
"Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .",happiness
I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .,neutral
"Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .",neutral
Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?,neutral
"Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?",neutral
History .,neutral
"Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your",neutral
Thirty percent ?,neutral
Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?,happiness
Yes . It's an excellent system .,happiness
"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?",neutral
"Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .",neutral
I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .,neutral
"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .",sadness
What ? Are you serious ?,surprise
But nobody uses Macintosh !,surprise
"That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma",neutral
"Yes , I'm from Taiwan .",neutral
"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .",neutral
But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .,neutral
There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .,neutral
Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .,sadness
"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .",neutral
"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .",happiness
"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .",happiness
"Excuse me , what's your name ?",neutral
My name is Jessica . What's yours ?,neutral
John .,neutral
You speak English very well .,happiness
Do you know what time it is ?,neutral
Sure . It's 5:10 PM .,neutral
What did you say ?,neutral
I said it's 5:10 PM .,neutral
Congratulations on the new house !,happiness
Thanks ! We love it .,happiness
"Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful .",happiness
I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !,neutral
It's taking you forever to do my hair .,anger
Give me a minute .,neutral
You should've been done already .,anger
There you go .,neutral
I don't think that you're done .,anger
What's wrong ?,neutral
My hair looks hideous .,anger
What's so bad about it ?,neutral
It doesn't look good at all .,anger
Sorry about that .,neutral
I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this .,anger
"Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ?",neutral
"David , I ' m going to China .",happiness
You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .,happiness
"Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate !",happiness
Thanks . Miss Zhang .,happiness
You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .,happiness
"Really ? I've already opened this one . Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit . Thank you ever so much .",surprise
You won ' t believe who ' s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ' Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !,anger
Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .,anger
"They were supposed to , but so far nobody ' s turned up , and I ' m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ' Ve had all day .",anger
They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .,anger
"What do you say to eating out , Maggie ?",happiness
"Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there .",happiness
Do we need to book a table in advance ?,happiness
No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays .,happiness
What time shall we go ?,happiness
Why not now ? I'm hungry .,happiness
"Look , who's here , Peter !",surprise
"Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris .",surprise
Just got back . Good to see you !,happiness
Good to see you too !,happiness
"Bill , Happy Halloween !",happiness
Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ?,happiness
I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs .,neutral
May I have a look at your costume ?,neutral
Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are .,neutral
I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool .,happiness
I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood .,happiness
Haha . Wish you good luck .,happiness
Hello ?,neutral
Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ?,neutral
"Oh , hi . I was just watching TV .",neutral
There's nothing to watch right now .,neutral
I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored .,neutral
Me too . Let's get together and do something .,happiness
"I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ?",happiness
Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow .,happiness
Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?,neutral
I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny .,happiness
That's great . We can do something outdoors then .,happiness

Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out .,neutral
Do you know what time it starts ?,neutral
It starts at one PM .,neutral
"Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there .",happiness
Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty .,happiness
There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester .,neutral
"Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ?",neutral
"To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring .",neutral
"I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ?",neutral
It might be the English teacher . What about you ?,neutral
"Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her .",neutral
She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English .,happiness
"Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing .",happiness
I think it's a good way to develop our language ability .,happiness
"Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us .",happiness
Can you believe me ?,happiness
Please count on my love .,happiness
I will .,happiness
I'll be yours through endless time .,happiness
I see . And I'll always be devoted to you .,happiness
"Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry .",happiness
I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie .,happiness
"My love will grow , like a river to flow .",happiness
"It can't be dry , and can't die .",happiness
I don't know whether we are in a dream .,happiness
"Aha , Aha ...",happiness

"Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us .",neutral
"Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ?",neutral
"I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed .",neutral
"Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ?",neutral
"Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things .",neutral
"Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him .",neutral
"Oh , sure .",neutral

"He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself .",surprise
He performs very well . He is so funny !,happiness

would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it .,neutral
"I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .",neutral
"Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ' t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ' t go together .",disgust
"I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .",neutral
"People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ' s more to do .",neutral
"I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ' re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .",happiness
"I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .",happiness
The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ' s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .,happiness
Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .,neutral

Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?,surprise
"No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !",anger
What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?,neutral
"I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .",anger
I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !,neutral
I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .,anger
"I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?",neutral
I guess so .,neutral
So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea !,neutral

"I bet you she regrets what she ' s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ' t she ?",neutral
I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though .,neutral

"Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?",happiness
"I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .",neutral

"So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?",neutral
I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .,neutral
Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?,neutral
Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .,neutral
"That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?",neutral

what's wrong with it ?,neutral
"well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .",neutral
when's the last time you had it serviced ?,neutral

what else is wrong with it ?,neutral
"the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !",neutral
anything else ?,neutral
the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .,neutral
why don't you get it all fixed ?,neutral

"It ' s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !",happiness
"If you like the class this much already , I ' m sure you will .",neutral
I hope so .,neutral
did she give you any homework ?,neutral
"not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,",happiness
no wonder you like the class so much .,happiness
I've got some great news for you !,happiness
did you get the position you wanted ?,neutral
"yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .",happiness
I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !,happiness
"thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .",neutral
"sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !",happiness
thank you very much .,happiness
you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader .,happiness
I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon .,happiness
that's very nice of you to say so . I'll try my best . When will you start at the new position ?,neutral
next week .,neutral
"so by then , you'll be in charge of the whole department .",neutral
absolutely .,neutral
Terrible . How about people's lives ?,neutral
"Fortunately , there is no person died .",happiness
That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .,happiness
Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world .,neutral
That's why many people died in the earthquake .,neutral
"Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other .",neutral
"Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .",neutral
"Yeah , we've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman .",neutral
We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake .,neutral
"Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .",happiness
That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography .,neutral
Do you have any hobbies ?,neutral
Yes . I like gardening .,neutral
"Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ?",happiness
"Yes , follow me . Here it is .",happiness
Your garden is really lovely .,happiness
Do you take care of them everyday ?,neutral
Don't you feel dull ?,neutral
I don't . I like the work .,neutral
How was the movie last night ?,neutral
I didn't really like it .,disgust
Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .,neutral
I found it very disappointing .,disgust
"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .",neutral
I wasn't happy with it .,disgust
Nothing is to your satisfaction .,neutral
What are you doing there with your mobile phone ?,happiness
I'm moblogging !,happiness
Moblogging ? what does that mean ?,surprise
"Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .",happiness
Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .,happiness
"Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .",happiness
How can you do that ?,neutral
"Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .",neutral
What if you want to publish some photos ?,neutral
"Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog .",neutral
I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you .,happiness
You bet it !,happiness
"so , how should we go to the theatre ?",neutral
let's take the bus .,neutral
"I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .",disgust
it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .,neutral
"it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .",neutral
"we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .",neutral
"train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .",neutral
"if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?",neutral
"we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .",neutral
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .,neutral
fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .,neutral
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .,neutral
don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .,happiness
"thanks , that was nice of you .",happiness
"see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !",happiness

There ' s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ?,happiness
"Oh , yes . I ' d love to .",happiness
Aren ' t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world .,happiness
I just don ' t find it very interesting .,neutral
I think it ' s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .,happiness
"I think that for a lot of people , it ' s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries .",neutral
I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .,happiness
"I ' m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ' s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .",neutral
"You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .",neutral
Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics .,happiness
Now there we are in agreement !,happiness
Hi ! How are you going ?,neutral

Really ! I've never seen so much work .,neutral
Right . How are you going to spend your weekend ?,neutral
I don't know . I have no idea .,neutral
Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ?,neutral
"I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible .",neutral
"You should try it . It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too . What do you say ?",neutral
"OK , but don't say I didn't warn you .",neutral
"That was a pretty good shot , Mary .",happiness
Thanks . This is fun !,happiness

No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before . Maybe I should learn to do something .,neutral
"Of course , you can . All you need is a little help and a lot of practice .",neutral

"Hi , Lucy !",happiness
"Hi . It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ?",happiness
"Yes , It's very great .",happiness
"Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ?",happiness

Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?,happiness
Yes . Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet .,happiness
"Oh , I'll try to catch it .",happiness
"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?",neutral
Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?,neutral
"What ? Ed , don ' t tell me you only have bad news !",surprise
"Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .",neutral
For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?,anger
"Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months .",neutral
What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ?,surprise
"Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .",neutral
Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !,surprise
"We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .",neutral
We ' re doomed !,anger
There is some really good news though !,neutral
Really ? What !,surprise
I got offered a new job !,neutral

"Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ?",happiness
"Oh , God . It ' s late . I ' m afraid I have to leave .",neutral
That ' s very kind of you . But if I don ' t go now I ' ll miss the last bus .,happiness
"How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ' ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise .",happiness

"I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester .",sadness
Have you tried university part-time jobs ?,neutral
"I mean in the library , or in some information center . Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .",neutral
"Yes , I know . I tried that . They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?",neutral
"Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard . That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .",neutral
I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal . But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .,sadness
"Anyway , there must be some solution . You know there are many people working illegally in New York .",neutral
But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .,neutral
I have an idea .,neutral
"Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown .",neutral
I already had that idea .,sadness
"Well , why don't you go and look down there ?",neutral
But I don't know what I would do .,neutral
"It may be part-time work as a waitress or something . It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .",neutral
Maybe . I don't know .,neutral
I will ask my friends for you . Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people . That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you . You might find something .,neutral
I have to find something . Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months .,sadness
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute .,neutral
"Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ?",neutral

"Yes , I like collecting antiques .",happiness
Why don't you get a new one ?,neutral
"I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .",neutral
"Really , what makes you say that ?",surprise
"Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?",neutral
"Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .",neutral
"Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?",happiness
Three . Two boys and a girl .,happiness

Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ?,neutral
"When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which -- is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?",neutral
"The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .",neutral
That's right . Why do you ask ?,neutral
"Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .",happiness

"For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .",neutral
"If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .",happiness

Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story .,surprise
But their love is touching !,neutral
"Ah , you're just too emotional .",neutral
I am not !,neutral
"Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ?",neutral
"John , I am just not in the mood for this .",sadness
You look so upset . What's going on ?,neutral
I lost the table tennis game yesterday .,sadness
"Oh , what a pity !",neutral
I just don ' t want to play table tennis any more .,sadness
Is it that bad ? It ' s nothing more than a game .,neutral
My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis .,sadness
"Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ' t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed .",happiness

"I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .",anger
You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .,neutral
"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .",neutral
"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" .",neutral
But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?,fear
"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .",neutral
"Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .",fear
"This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .",neutral
"Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .",neutral
"This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .",neutral
Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .,neutral
"Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion .",neutral
I'd be glad to tell you what I think .,happiness
Good ! I'm interested in your advice .,happiness
"If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .",neutral
"Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?",happiness
I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .,neutral
"You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ?",neutral
"Very good . But you should talk about your family , too .",happiness
I agree . I appreciate your helping me .,happiness
"Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department .",happiness
All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues .,happiness
You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding .,happiness

Thank you for your help .,happiness
So long . Thank you for shopping here .,happiness
What did you cook ?,neutral
"Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes .",happiness
Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?,happiness
"Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !",happiness
This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !,happiness
Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .,happiness
This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !,happiness
"Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !",happiness
"Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !",happiness
Want some more ?,neutral
I'm stuffed !,neutral
"I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .",happiness
"Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .",happiness

I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up .,happiness
"I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through .",happiness
"Yeah , you can make it .",happiness
"Happy birthday , John . Many happy returns of the day !",happiness
"Thank you , Alice . Come in to the dining-room . I ' m going to cut the cake soon . Have some please .",happiness
"Well , making good wishes .",neutral
Ok . I ' m pretty happy and I can go abroad .,happiness
Sure . We hope your wish will come true .,happiness
"What ' s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?",neutral
What ' s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job .,anger
"Then , buy a bottle of soft drink .",neutral
Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ?,neutral
"It ' s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .",neutral
"Ok , I will go there myself .",neutral
"Sorry , Mr . Polly .",sadness
"It doesn ' t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ?",surprise
Have a try .,neutral
Nothing much . I ' m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ' s all I have planned .,neutral
So you ' re free on Saturday night ?,neutral
That ' s right .,happiness
Would you like to have dinner with me ?,happiness

Who was the best teacher that you ever had ?,neutral
"That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher .",neutral
What was she like ?,neutral
"She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her .",happiness
What kind of things did you learn ?,neutral
She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do .,happiness
Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ?,surprise
"If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it .",neutral
You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ?,neutral
"She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined .",neutral
I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students .,neutral
Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ' t have any teacher ' s pets .,neutral
Really ? Doesn ' t every teacher have a teacher ' s pet ?,surprise
"Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ' t treat me any differently . She really didn ' t have any teacher ' s pets .",neutral
Do you know what she is doing now ?,neutral
"As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ' s book .",neutral
Have you ever read one of the books ?,neutral
Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books .,happiness
Why don ' t you recommend one to me ?,neutral

Good morning !,neutral
"Good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?",neutral
"I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares !",neutral
That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .,neutral
"I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .",neutral
"Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .",neutral
"That's annoying , but nothing to worry about .",neutral
"For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?",neutral
Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .,neutral
"Ok , I'll try that .",happiness
Is there anything else bothering you ?,neutral
Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .,neutral
Do you have any other plans this weekend ?,neutral
I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .,neutral
Try not to take on more than you can handle .,neutral
You're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks !,happiness
But you should tell me you were in love with her .,anger
"Well , I am telling you now .",neutral
I didn't think you would be interested .,neutral
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?,anger
"Oh , you men ! You are all the same .",anger
This is my house . Let me show you around it .,happiness
How beautiful the detached house is !,happiness
Follow me to the back-yard .,happiness

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?,anger
"It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine .",neutral
"Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops .",anger
"Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",anger
"True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?",neutral
Not funny .,neutral

No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .,neutral
She started feeling suspicious after you said that .,neutral
I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up .,sadness

Wow ! Good timing .,neutral
He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ?,happiness
Come on ! Three's a crowd !,neutral

"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",neutral
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",neutral
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,neutral
"Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .",surprise
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",neutral
"But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",neutral
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",neutral
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",neutral
"That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",neutral
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,neutral
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,neutral
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,neutral
How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?,surprise
"That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",neutral
"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",neutral
"Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",neutral
Why did they want to found a college ?,neutral
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .,neutral
"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .",neutral
When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?,neutral
"In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .",neutral
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .,neutral
"Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .",neutral
"Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .",neutral
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .,neutral
I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .,neutral
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,neutral
That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .,happiness
You can ask me any question at any time .,happiness
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .,neutral
"I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .",neutral
Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?,happiness
Why not ? I'd love to do that .,happiness
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .,neutral
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?,happiness
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?,neutral
I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .,neutral
"No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .",neutral
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .,surprise
Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum .,neutral
Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?,happiness
"Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ?",happiness
"Yes , let's do it .",happiness
Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them .,neutral
Of course not . We don't do that .,neutral
It's my new pendant . Do you like it ?,happiness

How did you first meet Jack each other ?,happiness

And then ?,happiness
"I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? '",happiness
Then he sent you to your home ?,happiness
Yeah .,happiness
It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty .,happiness
He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .,happiness
He is so humorous .,happiness
"What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today .",neutral
I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ?,sadness
"Well , English is a "" paper tiger "" . Its natural enemy is adequate practice .",neutral
"I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words .",sadness
"I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language .",neutral
Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time .,surprise
"Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you .",happiness
"Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf .",happiness

I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ' s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ' s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .,happiness
"You aren ' t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ' t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ' s your friends party .",neutral
"Aw come on ! It ' s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top .",neutral
"Well , I don ' t know .",neutral
Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ' t mind you going to her bachelorette party !,neutral
"Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ' m organizing her party !",happiness
Your knowledge of English is really surprising .,surprise
"No , seriously . I'm impressed .",happiness
I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?,neutral
It was terrific . The concert was really a hit . The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance .,happiness
Who was the conductor ?,neutral
"Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius . He did a perfect job . His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants .",happiness
"Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist .",happiness
Absolutely right . He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto . That caused a sensation . The audience were stunned by his pure tone .,happiness
Obviously you did enjoy the concert .,happiness
I have to talk to you !,anger
"What , Hilary ? I ' m really in a hurry !",surprise
"I know , Blake . But you ' Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company .",anger
"I ' Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ' t think it ' s worth it .",neutral
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would .,anger
I'm sorry to have made you disappointed .,neutral
That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .,anger
"Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize .",surprise
And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?,anger
Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .,neutral
"Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ?",neutral
"Oh , I took up a new hobby .",neutral
So you don't travel a lot now ?,neutral
"No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now .",happiness
It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .,happiness
It certainly is . It's so much fun .,happiness
I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?,neutral
Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .,happiness
"Well , every stamp has a story to tell .",happiness
You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps .,happiness
Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections .,neutral
There's a lot to share when you have a common interest .,neutral
"Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors .",happiness
"Ok , good luck . See you",happiness
"See you , Frank .",happiness
"Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?",neutral
You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .,neutral
What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .,neutral
Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?,neutral
I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .,neutral
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .,neutral
That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .,happiness
"Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too .",happiness
Good . Let ' s go now .,happiness
"are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !",neutral
"I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week .",neutral
"Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...",neutral
"No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage . And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .",neutral
"What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .",surprise
"They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .",neutral
That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?,anger
"I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .",neutral
it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now !,anger
Have you heard of the Love Bug ?,neutral
Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ?,neutral
Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year .,disgust
This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ?,disgust
"Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it .",neutral
So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick .,disgust

Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs !,happiness
Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself .,happiness
"Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile .",happiness
She is a real star . Not a onetime thing .,happiness
But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing !,happiness
"Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things .",happiness
"You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her .",happiness
Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?,happiness
Here is the programme . Check it out yourself !,happiness
"Happy Mother's Day , Mom !",happiness

Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ?,anger
I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ?,anger
"No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house .",anger

"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",surprise
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",surprise
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,surprise
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",surprise
"But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",surprise
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",surprise
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",surprise
"That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",surprise
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,surprise
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,surprise
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,surprise
"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",happiness
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,happiness
"Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .",happiness
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",happiness
"But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",happiness
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",happiness
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",happiness

Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",happiness
Really ?,happiness
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,happiness
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,happiness
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,happiness
How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?,happiness
"That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",happiness
"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",happiness
"Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",happiness
Why did they want to found a college ?,happiness
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .,happiness
"Oh , I see .",happiness
"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .",happiness
When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?,happiness
"In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .",happiness
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .,happiness
"Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .",happiness
"Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .",happiness
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .,happiness
I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .,happiness
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",happiness
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,happiness
Are you free this Saturday evening ?,happiness
"Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening .",happiness
At our club .,happiness
When ?,happiness
At 7:30 p . m .,happiness
"I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away .",anger
I knew this would happen some day .,anger

I think we can still talk .,anger
"I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away .",disgust
I knew this would happen some day .,disgust
"Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ?",disgust
I think we can still talk .,disgust
No way ! Please don't follow me around .,disgust
"Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ?",disgust
"Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too .",disgust
I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life !,disgust
"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous , so everyone loves them .",anger
I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .,anger
"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ?",anger
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .,anger
"Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea",anger
I think you should give them some credit . They ' re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves,anger
it's getting cold .,happiness
"Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ?",anger
Why do you say such words ? I love you very much .,anger
"Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ' s .",anger
"Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply .",anger
"But honey , I think you ' re terrific . There is nothing ...",anger
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now .,surprise
"What's your favorite course , Daniel ?",surprise
I like science most .,surprise
I thought you would like PE .,surprise
"I do like PE , but I am interested in science .",surprise
"Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly .",surprise
Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy .,surprise

Is that where you park ?,surprise
"Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in .",surprise
Thank you . Where is your key ?,surprise
"There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .",surprise
"There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .",happiness
"That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment .",happiness
Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out .,happiness
"Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?",happiness
"When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .",happiness
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .,happiness
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .,surprise
"Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .",surprise
What does it come with standard ?,surprise
"On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well . The Accord com",surprise
Cruise control ? I don't like that .,surprise
What does it come with standard ?,happiness
"On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well . The Accord com",happiness
Cruise control ? I don't like that .,happiness
"Why not , sir ?",happiness
I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?,happiness
"Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .",happiness
I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .,happiness
"You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .",happiness
I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?,happiness

I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .,happiness
"Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .",happiness
"We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .",happiness
"I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?",happiness
"Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?",happiness
My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .,happiness
"Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .",happiness

"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",fear
"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",fear
"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",fear
Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,fear

You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .,fear
"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .",fear

"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain .

Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? What ? Why do we have to do that ?,surprise
"Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? What ? Why do we have to do that ? Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",anger

I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time .

Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon !

That's not very fair . What did you do ? There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !",anger

Your dress really goes well with your shoes . I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? I got it on sale down at the department store . When did you go there ? I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . I guess that you will really be dressing down . That's my style when I'm not in the office . Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .",happiness

Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . Really ? What happened ? He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home .",sadness

I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older . I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . Great .

"Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . Me too . Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .",happiness

I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ? It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . Why does he want to do that ? Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . Won ' t they get his inheritance ? No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .",happiness

If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess . For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ? Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost . Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . We ' re doomed ! There is some really good news though ! Really ? What !",surprise

I can never do anything right when she's around . For example ? Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .",happiness

"Good morning ! Good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares ! That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . What's that ? Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . That's annoying , but nothing to worry about . For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . Ok , I'll try that .",happiness

There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",fear

But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .",fear

I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .",happiness

It's only a two-seater , you know ! what else is wrong with it ? the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer ! anything else ? the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . why don't you get it all fixed ? it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ' d love to go for a ride in it !",happiness

How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops . Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",anger

Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? Three . Two boys and a girl .",happiness

I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .",happiness

"I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake . It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .
