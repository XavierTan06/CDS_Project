"Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ?",3
Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ?,3
How about Legally Blonde .,4
"Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ?",4
Isn't that a scary movie ?,4
"How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun .",4
Ok . I'll give it a try .,3
That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class .,3
Ok . See you tomorrow .,3
"Ann , it's terrible !",0
What's up ?,4
"Look , this is a pimple !",4
"Oh , I think it is .",4
How come ?,4
I think it's because of your bad habits !,0
"I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .",4
"I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .",4
I wasn't aware of that !,6
You should do better later .,4
What a great weekend that was !,3
My feelings exactly .,3
I really enjoy the beach in the summer .,3
I couldn't agree with you more .,3
We should come here more often .,3
You are absolutely right .,3
I'd like to come back next weekend .,3
That's exactly the way I feel .,3
"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .",3
"Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too .",3
I guess we'll see each other around .,3
"Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy .",3
You too .,3
Haven't seen you for a long time,3
I've been away on a vacation .,3
I bet you had a wonderful time,3
"Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends",3
Sounds great,3
"how was school today , Dominic ?",4
I hate school !,1
why ? What happened ?,6
I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today !,1
it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ?,4
"yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed !",1
why didn't you do a good job ?,4
"I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank .",4
do you think you studied enough for the exam ?,4
no ...,4
what did you do last night ?,4
I watched TV .,4
did you study at all last night for your exam ?,4
"no , not really .",4
"I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ?",4
tomorrow .,4
alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare .,4
My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race .,6
"Excuse me , what did you say ?",6
A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games .,3
That's incredible . I can't believe it .,6
You have to . It is sure .,3
How amazing !,6
You look like a basket case .,4
I'm not surprised .,4
What's the problem ?,4
My brother in-law just dropped in from the states .,1
"Yeah , and ?",4
"I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake !",1
Why ?,4
"He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile .",1
I guess you think twice next time he comes .,4
You can say that again .,4
So how long has he here for ?,4
Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming .,4
"Well , I know you do the right thing .",4
What are you doing ?,4
What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ' t you know what day it is ?,4
Mumm . no .,4
It ' s only the day when the world ' s biggest sporting event is kicking off .,4
What ?,4
The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ' s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ' s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa,3
I have no idea what you ' re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl .,6
"This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g",4
"Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ' t really appeal to me .",4
"Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ' s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec",6
"All I know about soccer is that you can ' t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !",1
"Whatever , I ' m going to go watch the opening match .",4
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?,4
"yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ?",4
I was at home with my parents in New York City .,4
really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?,4
"I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .",4
that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?,4
"no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos .",4
did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?,4
"yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .",4
did he survive ?,4
"unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .",5
I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .,5
it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .,0
terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .,4
Can I help you ?,4
"I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .",4
I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?,4
My paper is on the influence of television on children .,4
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .,4
Thank you for you help .,3
Have you seen that house ?,3
"Yes , it looks interesting .",3
You're right . I love it very much .,3
It must be old .,4
At least more than 100 years old .,4
Let's enter it !,4
I can't open the door .,4
It must be locked .,4
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .,4
She can't answer you .,4
She must be deaf .,4
It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?,4
Frightened ? You must be joking .,6
Where are you going this weekend ?,4
I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day .,4
So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ?,3
Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ?,3
"Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel .",3
Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ?,3
Your tent and enough food and water .,3
"You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ?",3
"We can go fishing , chatting and camping .",3
What are we waiting for ? Come on !,3
Don't hurry . Wait for my call .,3
"It's a fine day today , isn't it ?",3
"Yes , it is . It ' s wonderful after the downpour .",3
How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .,3
I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .,4
"Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .",4
You're right . We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .,4
Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .,6
The weatherman predicts a fine day today .,4
The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast .,4
Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ?,4
No . What ?,4
He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail .,4
"No . Really , what happened ?",6
"Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk .",4
Was he out with the guys from the bank ?,4
"Yes , I think so .",4
"Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk .",4
"Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know .",4
"Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife .",6
"No , she left him last year .",4
"Oh , really ? Do you know why ?",6
"Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ?",4
He lost his wallet and keys .,4
"Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police .",4
"Oh , no .",4
"Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story",4
So then what happened ?,4
"Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out .",4
"Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation .",4
"Yes , I know .",4
Are you ready to go the concert ?,4
Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?,4
"Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .",3
"That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then .",3
Is your helmet comfortable ?,3
"Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .",3
Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .,3
I'll think about it .,3
Is that your new bicycle ?,3
"Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?",3
It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !,3
Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .,4
I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ?,4
"Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?",4
That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .,4
Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?,4
It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go .,4
"Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?",4
Cut what out I ' m not doing anything .,4
The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ' s driving me crazy .,0
Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !,0
"I don ' t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ' re shouting into your phone all the time ?",0
You ' Ve got to be kidding me ! You ' re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?,0
"Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ' s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ' s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ' m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .",4
Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .,4
"Yeah , I ' ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?",4
How's your thesis going ?,4
"Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done .",5
"I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing .",5
"Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me .",5
"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",2
What is it ? What happened ?,4
I think someone is stalking me .,2
"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",6
"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",2
What did you do ?,4
"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",2
Did he leave when you left ?,4
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,4
He followed me all the way home !,2
That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .,4
"Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?",2
"Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .",4
Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !,2
Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .,4
I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .,4
"Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out . If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police . But for now , just try not to worry .",4
Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .,4
"Jim , I heard you ' Ve bought a new computer .",3
"Yes . Look , it is on my desk .",3
"Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ?",3
Not at all . It ' s a piece of cake .,4
A piece of cake ?,6
Yes . It ' s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it .,3
Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ?,4
I would love to help you prepare for your presentation .,3
I hate to ask you to do something like that .,4
This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that .,3
When could we get together ?,4
I could easily give you some time tomorrow night .,4
Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ?,3
"Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ?",3
I'll come prepared .,3
Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet .,3
"So , Emily , how was your day ?",4
I don't think you really want to hear about it .,5
It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .,4
"To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !",1
Why ? What happened ?,4
"Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !",0
That's not very fair . What did you do ?,4
"There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure .",1
Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?,4
"He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !",0
Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?,4
I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !,0
Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?,4
Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .,4
That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders .,4
"I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .",4
"That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .",4
Then I'll take them . How much ?,3
$ 120 . The small gift box is complementary .,3
Here is $ 150 . Keep the change .,3
Thank you ! Have a nice day !,3
You too . Bye .,3
"Hello , Helen .",4
"Hi , Steven .",4
How are you today ?,4
"I ' m very well , Thank you . And you ?",3
"I ' m fine , thanks . How is Tony ?",3
"He ' s fine , Thanks . How ' s Emma ?",3
"She ' s very well , too , Helen . Goodbye , Helen . Nice to see you .",3
"Nice to see you , too , Steven . Goodbye .",3
I have an idea for Christmas this year .,4
What is it ?,4
Let's not exchange any gifts at all .,3
You big scrooge !,3
Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !,3
But you may have some trouble convincing the kids .,4
"Actual 1y , it was their idea first .",4
Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas .,3
"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ?",3
"To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here .",3
"The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else .",3
"Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?",3
"Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game .",4
Who plays who ?,4
"Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .",4
It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?,4
In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .,4
I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .,4
"Oh , you know something . He is 2 . 26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .",4
I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .,4
"Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .",4
"That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy .",4
"Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ?",4
You are always so naughty .,4
"Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker !",3
"Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ?",3
I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ?,3
"Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ?",3
That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ?,3
I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division .,3
What should I get Uncle Teddy ?,4
You could get him a tie .,4
Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .,6
Why not ?,4
Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .,4
"Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .",4
That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise . But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .,3
"He would think you were crazy , Caroline .",4
"Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .",4
How much do you want to spend ?,4
"Well , he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .",4
"Alright , I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .",4
Yes .,4
"Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .",4
What should he have then ?,4
"I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .",4
I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?,3
I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .,4
Alright . We can go later then .,4
"We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .",4
Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?,3
She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .,4
Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them . And what about Dad ?,4
How about the iguana ?,4
I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .,4
A tie ?,4
"Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ?",0
I was just kidding .,4
I decided to give it a go !,3
Good for you . What items did you bid on ?,3
A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !,3
Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !,3
Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty !,3
That's not how this game works .,4
"Well , there was a sign that said "" Buy now for seventy . """,4
How many bids had been placed before you ?,4
I hear you are moving to Dalian .,3
Yes . I found a very good job down here .,3
"Well , we'll certainly miss you here .",3
"I am going to miss you , too .",3
Let's keep in touch .,3
OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there .,3
I think your speech was excellent .,3
Was it ?,4
Sure it was .,3
"Thank you . It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know .",3
But you did it and did it well !,3
"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",0
What ? What did you buy ?,4
It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,0
What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,4
"There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .",4
And ?,4
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,4
And it's a brick ?,4
I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,6
"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",4
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,4
"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",4
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,6
He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,4
"Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",4
"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",4
That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,4
"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?",4
"Wow , the view from the peak is so grand !",3
"Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red .",3
Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?,4
"Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child .",4
But my father did not . He didn't have much time .,4
"Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent .",3
Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?,6
"Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time .",4
It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?,4
Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty .,4
Can I see the rainbow ?,4
"That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks .",4
"Why don ' t you sit down and relax , darling ?",4
I don ' t want to .,0
"Well , come and talk to me then .",4
Certainly not .,0
May I turn on the radio then ?,4
Turn on the radio ? What for ?,0
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .,4
Listen to some music ? And who ' ll cook dinner ? Will you ?,0
"Ok , I will . But let ' s go to a disco after dinner .",4
"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .",0
Have you been to Shanghai before ?,4
Yes I have . I ' Ve been there three times in the past year .,3
That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ?,3
No I haven ' t . I haven ' t visited the Bund either . I ' Ve always had too much work to do .,3
"So you haven ' t done much then , in Shanghai ?",4
"Actually , I ' Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious !",3
"What do you do in your free time , Nancy ?",4
"Well , I like playing the violin .",4
Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ?,4
About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school .,4
That's really interesting .,3
Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ?,3
"Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though .",3
Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby .,3
"I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor .",3
"That's all tight , Mr . Smith . That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon .",3
I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks .,3
"No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks .",3
I will . It's most thoughtful of you .,3
What's in the box ?,4
"Sandy , I think we made a mistake ...",4
What do you mean ?,4
It's a cute little teddy bear !,3
How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !,3
And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card .,6
Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone !,3
"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?",4
"It ' s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ' t wear perfume .",4
I ' m sorry . I didn ' t know that .,4
That ' s all right . Thank you all the same .,3
"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .",4
"A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?",4
"There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .",4
I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .,5
What about sunday ?,4
"I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday .",4
Maybe next week .,4
"Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .",4
"Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .",5
"I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .",5
I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods .,4
"Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ?",6
I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that .,4
My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ?,6
Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ?,4
What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now .,5
But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?,4
"It seems that I have nothing to do , except this .",5
Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss .,4
It ' s very kind of you to invite me to dinner .,3
Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ' t stand on ceremony .,3
This dish is really delicious .,3
I ' m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it .,3
You ' re great . Could you say it in Chinese ?,3
"Sure , we call it doubt .",3
"Welcome , Ron , come on in !",3
"Hi , Malia ! What a nice home !",3
We enjoy it too !,3
How long have you lived here ?,3
About four years now .,3
"Well , it is very beautiful .",3
"Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink .",3
Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside !,3
"I have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice .",3
Mango juice would be perfect . Thank you !,3
We are through .,0
Why ?,6
"Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day .",0
"I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her .",5
"But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home .",0
That girl was my cousin .,5
You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone .,0
I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time .,5
I don't buy a story .,0
"I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow .",5
"No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again .",0
The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off .,3
That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines .,3
Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal .,3
Do you prefer brandy or ports .,3
"Port , please .",3
Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .,3
The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?,3
Yes . You always have a good nose for wines .,3
Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .,3
"Oh , what's that ?",6
It's made from naturally frozen grapes .,3
Why not ? It sounds great .,3
"OK , here's to your health .",3
Thanks . Cheers .,3
Cheers .,3
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from .,3
"Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning .",3
I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today .,3
"But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil .",3
A match made in heaven .,3
"Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ?",4
"Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake .",5
What happened ?,4
I really wish I hadn ' t done it .,5
What on earth are you talking about ?,4
I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed .,5
What were you thinking ?,4
"You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well .",5
But what you should do is study hard .,4
"I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ' t study , and I cheated , and I got caught .",5
So long as you learn from your mistakes .,4
"Happy New Year , Jim !",3
"Thank you , same to you ! Lee , have you got any plans ?",3
"Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family .",3
How nice ! Have fun !,3
I don't think you really want to hear about it .,0
"To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !",0
"There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure .",0
"He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !",0
Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?,4
That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .,4
Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ?,3
I'd like that very much .,3
How does 7:30 sound ?,3
Fine . See you later .,3
"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .",4
I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .,4
"Come on , nothing can be that bad .",4
"But promise me , you'll keep it a secret .",4
"Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?",4
I've fallen in love with my boss .,4
Really ? Is he married ?,6
"Bo , of course not . He is still single .",4
Then what's your problem ?,4
I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .,5
"Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .",4
"Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .",5
Office romance is very tricky .,4
It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .,5
"Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .",4
Listen to this . Mary got married .,4
Is she really ? I can ' t believe it !,6
Yes . Yesterday .,4
Good gracious . That ' s incredible !,6
She married Jerrod .,4
You ' re kidding .,6
She ' s going to live in Paris .,4
Really ? I ' m surprised .,6
"This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time .",0
I won't do it again . Please forgive me .,5
No way . I've given you too many chances already .,0
How do you like this dress ?,3
It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?,3
"Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ?",4
Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year .,4
People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve .,4
Any other common customs of your New Year ?,4
"Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution .",4
What's that ?,4
"It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days !",4
"By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ?",4
"We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too .",3
Thanks a lot .,3
"Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy .",3
"Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you .",3
"Nice meeting you , too .",3
Come over and visit when you have time .,3
Thanks for the invitation . I will !,3
"Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ' ll be able to relax in the sun while they ' re playing .",3
"It does seem like the perfect day ! I ' m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels .",3
There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect .,3
"Ok kids , here ' sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ' t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes .",3
And stay in the shallow area . I don ' t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ' s too deep out there and we didn ' t bring your floatier .,3
"You ' re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ' ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ' ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows .",4
"What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you !",4
Ah ! Not on me ! Ow !,4
Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country .,3
Really ? He is so great .,6
You don't want to join him ?,3
Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays .,3
"Yes , and I want to have a try .",3
Do you have a park in the city ?,3
"Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful .",3
That ' s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon .,3
It ' s a good idea . But I am afraid it ' s too cold . It is very windy on the lake .,3
Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park .,3
How are you doing ?,4
Everything ' s fine with me .,4
What can I do for you today ?,4
Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ?,4
"Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today .",5
Why can ' t I view it today ?,4

I understand . May I make an appointment then ?,4
How does this Friday sound ?,4
Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect .,3
That will be fine .,3
Thanks for your help .,3
"I ' m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !",3
My first grandchild .,3
"And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .",3
"Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ' s got Richard ' s eyes though .",3
"Yes , he does have Richard ' s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .",3
"Well , children usually resemble their parents .",4
It ' s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is .,4
You often like comparing children with their parents .,4
You ' re right .,4
Hey ! I have a surprise for you .,3
What is it ?,3
Open this card and read .,3
A trip to China for summer vacation . Wow ! What a wonderful surprise ! Thank you . This is the best surprise I've ever had .,6
The Blacks got divorced .,4
Really ? Why ?,6
Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side .,4
"Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?",4
"No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time .",4
"Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ?",6
No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up .,3
"I like that joke , but I hope it's true .",3
This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .,3
"Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ' t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .",3
So it has attracted more and more customers these days .,3
"Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .",3
Why is the long face ?,4
I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more .,1
Did you just get your review or something ?,4
"Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long .",5
That sucks .,4
I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies .,0
Look on the bright side . At least you have a job .,4
Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it .,3
"Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight .",3
How about a cold bottle of beer .,3
Now you're talking .,3
your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta,3
would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking .,3
this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax .,3
"cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ?",3
"ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?",4
"sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too .",4
that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?,4
that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .,4
"fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .",4
"you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?",4
I don't think it's broken .,4
"well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !",4
fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help .,3
"How do you like skiing , Pat ?",4
I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year .,3
I suppose skiing is easy for you .,4
"No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better .",4
I see . Do you ski often ?,4
Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night .,3
That sounds great .,3
"Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ?",3
Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg,2
Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill .,3
"Going to the gym tonight , Mary ?",4
"Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong .",4
That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ?,3
I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend .,3
I'll get my things and meet you there .,3
Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .,3
"Nice and warm again , isn ' t it ?",3
"Oh , it ' s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week .",3
How are you these days ?,3
"Fine , thank you . And you ?",3
"Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week .",3
"Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door .",3
"Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you .",3
Nice to meet you too .,3
Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice .,3
Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ?,3
"Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well .",3
"Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .",3
"You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street .",3
There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .,3
"Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way .",3
That would be wonderful . Thanks !,3
I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ?,3
"So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good .",3
What part of the film do you like best ?,3
"Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most .",3
"I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears .",3
"Actually , tears also came to my eyes .",3
It has got this year's Oscar Award .,3
It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration .,3
What case do you have against the police ?,4
I want to take them to court for arresting me .,0
I don ' t understand .,4
There was no reason for them to arrest me .,0
"They let you go , didn ' t they ?",4
They released me the next morning .,0
They detained you at the station ?,4
That ' s exactly what they did .,0
Why did they arrest you ?,4
They said I matched the description of a robber .,4
I get it now .,4
I ' m definitely taking them to court .,0
My friend Jane is very beautiful .,3
What's her figure ?,4
"Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too .",3
What's the color of her eyes ?,4
Dark blue .,3
how old is she ?,4
Twenty .,3
I hear Jean married a business tycoon .,4
That's true . Her husband is a fat cat .,1
But I don't think she really loves him .,4
She is only after his money .,1
"If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love .",4
But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough .,1
"David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ?",4
It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched .,4
I am so nervous now . What a terrific game !,3
Which side are you on ?,3
"It's hard to say , because each team has my idols .",3
"Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know .",3
I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct .,3
What a good goal !,3
I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand .,3
Me too . I like the festival best of all .,3
"Think of the big face down the eve , hmm .",3
"And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play .",3
"Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ?",4
Such as ?,4
You know why fire crackers are set off in festival .,4
Why ? To welcome the new year of course ?,4
And also to frighten away evil spirits .,4
Really ?,6
And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year .,4
"Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels .",4
"Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?",4
Don't brother me !,0
"Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help .",4
"Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault .",5
"So , what's the problem ?",4
I drew a blank on the algebra test .,5
No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?,6
"Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test .",5
"That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester .",4
I'm thinking of dropping out .,5
"You can't do that , Jenny !",6
"I'm dead serious about this , Sally .",5
"Come on , let's talk about it .",4
"Hi . Ed , what's up ?",4
Nothing .,4
Doesn't look like it to me .,4
Just get out of my face !,0
"Woo , easy .",4
Leave me alone !,0
What are you so ticked off about ?,4
I don't want to talk about it .,4
Maybe I could help .,4
I blew the finally exam .,5
You've got be joking .,6
"No , I'm not .",4
"Well , don't get bend on a ship about it .",4
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year .,3
What a great idea !,3
January would be a good month for a mountain retreat .,3
"I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January .",3
"You know , now that I think about it , you might be right .",3
April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements .,3
That is a good suggestion .,3
We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them .,3
"Yeah , that would let us know what would work best .",3
I'll put the survey online this afternoon .,3
I really like the book you lent me the other day .,3
I'm glad you like it .,3
And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .,3
Not at all .,3
Everyone in our class enjoyed it too . It ' s very interesting .,3
"Oh , I'm glad .",3
Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?,3
No problem .,3
"Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress .",3
Thanks . Does it suit me ?,4
"Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ' t think I ' Ve seen anything like it before .",3
I know . That ' s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing .,3
"And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously .",3
"It ' s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact .",3
Thank you for saying so .,3
What a beautiful view .,3
It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this .,3
What is that below ?,3
It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish .,3
No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me .,4
There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp .,3
"Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .",3
It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .,3
That's true .,3
"Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?",3
"Sure , let ' s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original .",3
Thanks .,3
I can tell you worked hard on it .,3
I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .,3
"Well , it was definitely worth all the time .",3
Let ' s just hope my teacher agrees .,3
Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ?,4
Which one will you be going to ?,4
We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street .,4
"Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself .",3
I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm .,4
"OK , can I bring a date with me ?",4
"Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations .",3
Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit .,3
Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four .,3
"I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ?",3
Not that I know of . Why do you ask ?,4
I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I .,4
I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced . You should be fine .,4
One last question . Is there a dress code there ?,4
"No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home .",4
Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight .,3
I'll see you there at 9pm .,3
Okay . See you then .,3
"Can I help you , sir ?",4
"Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife .",4
What kind of presents do you want ?,4
"Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ?",4
"OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59 . 95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America .",4
"Hey , How did you know I came from America ?",6
"Just a hunch , sir .",4
How much again ?,4
$ 59 . 95 .,4
"That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs .",3
"Sorry , sir .",4
"Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .",4
"Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume .",4
That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY .,3
DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml . DKNY ?,4
It's $ 60 here .,4
That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ?,6
"Of course not , sir .",4
"OK , I'll take one .",4
"Happy anniversary , sweetheart !",3
Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers !,3
I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering .,3
"Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing .",3
"That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song .",3
I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?,3
Always .,3
"Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment .",5
"Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place .",6
"Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon .",4
No problem . Call me when you get back .,4
"I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ?",4
"That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you .",3
"Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday .",4
Great ! That's settled then .,3
OK .,4
"How are you doing , Andrew ?",4
Not well . I ' Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately .,4
But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ?,4
"You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ' t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends .",4
What about me ? I ' m your friend .,4
"I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes .",4
"I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ' s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ?",4
Not at all .,4
I ' Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .,3
That ' s a good idea .,3
What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ?,4
I ' m not sure . I guess I ' d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .,4
People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club .,3
That ' s a possibility . Thanks !,3
This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink .,3
Isn ' t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ' s safe .,3
"Don ' t worry about them . They ' re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ' s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ?",3
The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ' s a special one just for kids .,3
"So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ' t been to one for ages .",3
That ' s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids .,3
"Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ' t sunbathe all day .",3
Hey Joanne . What are you up to ?,4
I'm just watching some television .,4
I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .,4
Me too . Do you think we are boring people ?,4
I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .,4
That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ?,4
"That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings .",4
I like to play the piano for fun .,3
Yeah . That can be a good hobby .,3
Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .,3
That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same .,3
"Nice weather , honey !",3
The days are getting longer !,3
May and Daniel often like this kind of weather .,3
"Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot .",3
"Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ?",3
That's great !,3
"Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time .",3
And this kind of weather is rare for the season either .,3
"Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot .",3
So we must seize this chance to go the beach .,3
Daniel loves the beach very much !,3
He will enjoy himself this weekend .,3
"Hello Bill , what's new ?",3
Bob and Mary are back together .,3
I'm glad to hear it .,3
"Me too , they're such a nice couple .",3
How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations !,3

I promise !,3
"Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' !",4
What's Net Love ?,4
Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love .,4
Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex !,6
Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ?,4
How could you know ?,6
I watched the screen display !,4
Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca !,4
"It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA !",4
Impossible !,6
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?,3
"Oh , that sounds great !",3
"I ' ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ?",3
"Yes , that would be perfect .",3
See you tonight then .,3
Yes . Thank you for inviting me .,3
I'm so glad we decided to go on a cruise for our vacation .,4
Are you even glad that we get to buy new clothes too ?,3
"Ah , that's all part of the fun . What do you think of these shorts ?",3
They look really good on you . They look comfortable too .,3
They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too .,4
Okay . I chose this swimming suit . Do you like it ?,4
Wow . You look great .,3
"Great and white ! Which reminds me , let's pick up some heavy duty sunscreen !",4
Thanks for lunch . It was delicious .,3
It's OK .,3
Next time lunch is on me .,3
Don't be silly .,6
I'm serious .,3
All right . Next time you will treat .,3
It's a deal .,3
It ' s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ?,4
Don ' t touch that thermostat ! You don ' t pay the bills around here !,0
"Dad ! Are you serious ? What ' s the point of having central heating if we can ' t use it ! Look , I can see my breath !",6
Put on a sweater ! I ' m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ' s a bit chilly .,0
Dad ! I ' m gonna catch a cold !,0
"When I was your age , my parents didn ' t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful !",0
"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous , so everyone loves them .",4
I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .,4
"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ?",4
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .,4
"No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ' t even pay for Drin",0
"Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea",4
"I don ' t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ' re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored .",0
I think you should give them some credit . They ' re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves,4
Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .,0
I think that ' s settled .,4
I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are !,0
How dare you speak to me like this .,0
Why not ?,0
"Hey , Jack , where's your car ?",4
I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one .,4
Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ?,6
"Hop in , I'll give you a ride .",3
"Ok . Boy , this looks expensive .",3
"Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ?",3
"Wow , this thing can haul .",3
"Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned .",3
"I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .",3
We are on the high way . Find the pound shade ..,3
"Wow , this car can really burn rubber .",3
It's a great feeling .,3
"You made a perfect choice , Jack .",3
"Thanks , Daisy .",3
You look like being on cloud nine .,4
I am .,4
What has made you so happy ?,4
I think I'm in love .,3
Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ?,6
Her name is Jenny .,4
How did you meet her ?,4
We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other .,4
What do you like best about her ?,4
She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time .,3
I guess it was fate working to bring you together .,4
"Whatever brought us together , I'm happy .",3
"That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings .",3
Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ?,4
Steven ! What ' s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ' t know you have a gun ! What ' s going on !,2
"I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you .",4
"Steven , I ...",2
"I haven ' t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ' m sorry . I ' m not a fireman . I ' m not even from the United States . I ' m a spy for the Indian government .",4
What ? Why didn ' t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ?,6
"When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau .",4
"What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me !",0
"I ' m sorry , I wasn ' t supposed to meet you . I wasn ' t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real .",4
I can ' t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ' t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car !,0
"Veronica , wait !",4
"Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ?",4
Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ?,4
"Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .",3
Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .,3
"Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .",3
That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes .,3
"When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her .",3
It seems you two bring out the best of one another .,3
Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .,3
"Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other .",3
"Thanks , I think so too .",3
"Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night !",3
You mean with my performance ?,3
"Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type .",3
I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve .,4
Where did you learn to sing like that ?,4
I was part of a band in school .,4
You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ?,6
Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ?,4
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .,3
It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .,3
Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .,3
Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY !,0
What !,6
Wow ! What's that ?,4
It's my new radio earphone .,3
It's so small that I didn't notice it .,4
What were you screaming at me for ?,4
"Hi , Becky , what's up ?",4
"Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .",4
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .,4
For example ?,4
"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .",4
"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .",4
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .,4
"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .",4
You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?,4
"We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .",4
That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .,3
Do you like traveling ?,4
"Yes , I've just come back from Scotland .",4
Where did you visit ?,4
I only had time to visit Edinburgh .,4
How did you like it ?,4
It's fantastic .,3
Why did you go there ?,4
I went there on business .,4
And do you have friends there ?,4
"Yes , a lot of friends .",3
You must have enjoyed yourself .,3
"Yes , and I took many pictures .",3
It smells like an ashtray in here !,0
Hi honey ! What ' s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?,4
What ' s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .,0
No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ' t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !,4
"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ' s not like you can just light up like before .",0
"I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ' t have the willpower to just quit . I can ' t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?",4
Fine ! I want a divorce !,0
"If ever you ' re in Chicago , please do look me up .",3
"Well , yes , I ' d like to , if it ' s not too much trouble .",3
No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well .,3
That ' d be fine .,3
We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ?,4
Okay . But what is a tailgate party ?,4
Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck !,3
How fun ! Can I bring something ?,3
Don't worry about it ! Just come at five .,4
I make a mean potato salad !,4
"Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad !",3
Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you !,3
Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ' t just stand there ! Come and take a seat !,3
"Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy .",4
"Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks !",3
Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .,4
"Don ' t you worry , I ' ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ' s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you !",3
Um ... no .,4
"Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece !",3
"So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ?",4
I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came .,3
Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping .,3
"I love the museums , too .",3
But the traffic is pretty bad .,3
Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy .,3
"Listen , it's almost dinnertime . There are lots of restaurant around here . What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ?",3
I can't stand making decisions . You choose !,3
OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ?,3
"Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ?",4
"Hello , there , my name is Tonia .",4
Do you sing alto ?,4
"Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you .",4
Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone .,3
Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them .,3
I heard them warming up earlier . You're right .,3
It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone !,3
Guess who I saw yesterday ?,4
I don't know . Who ?,4
Avril Lavigen !,3
The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ?,6
"Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ...",4
"So you're a big fan , eh ?",4
"Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too .",4
"And she was in a movie once again , right ?",4
"Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great .",4
What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ?,4
She looked sweeter than her pictures .,4
Did you take a photo with her ?,4
"No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs .",4
Crazy !,6
What ? What did you buy ?,6
"There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick .",0
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,4
Look what you've done !,0
"I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately .",5
"Yes , and hurry up !",0
I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ?,5
"No , I'll do it myself .",4
"Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ?",4
"I should think so , too !",4
I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble .,5
"Yes , and please be more careful in the future !",0
"I will , sir . I'm really very sorry .",5
That's OK .,4
You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish .,3
"No , thanks . I have had enough .",3
What about some drink ?,3
Please bring me a cup of coffee .,3
"David , I ' m going to China .",4
Really ? How do you get the chance ?,6
You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .,4
Congratulations . How lucky you are !,3
Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .,3
I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .,3
I ' m sure I will .,3
"Have a nice journey , Lily .",3
"Thank you , David .",3
I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course . Do you think it's a good idea,4
Sure ! You should do anything you can to improve your English .,4
Really ? Do you think English is that important ?,6
"Of course it is . In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want .",4
Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend .,3
Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration .,4
"No , I left it at home . Sorry !",4
That's OK . I can get it from you later .,4
"So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ?",4
"All right . I know a great restaurant near here . But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me .",4
No problem . I just got paid . It ' s my treat .,4
"Thank you ! I'll be sure to return the favor after our first class , OK ?",4
"Forget it ! That's what friends are for ! Besides , I have a VIP card for a discount .",3
Good job ! This is going to be a great night !,3
I think so too . Let ' s go !,3
"It ' s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ' s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ' m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland .",3
"Thank you , Rick . We ' Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .",3
"The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !",3
"Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play .",3
"It ' s China ' s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .",3
"Brazil calls for a time out and we ' ll be right back , after a short commercial break .",3
You don't look too well . What's going on ?,4
I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills .,5
I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ?,4
"I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it .",5
That's tough . What does your wife think about this ?,4
"She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well .",4
I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do .,3
I really appreciate your help .,3
"No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this .",3
"Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty !",1
"Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ?",4
"I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it !",1
"You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ?",4
I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here !,1
"Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ?",4
Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor .,4
You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here !,4
Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days .,4
Why ? What's eating her ?,6
Love sick . You know who she's in love with ?,4
I don't have the slightest idea .,4
Someone you're living with .,4
"What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ?",6
"Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack .",4
No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl .,6
The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him .,4
And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection .,4
"Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it .",4
"Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ' t know each other , do you ?",3
No . I ' Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet .,3
How do you do ? I ' m pleased to meet you .,3
How do you do ?,3
Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home .,3
What would you like to drink ?,3
"A cup of coffee , please .",3
"It's a lovely day , isn't it ?",3
"Yes , the weather sure is nice today .",3
I love it when the weather is like this . Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?,3
"That sounds like a good idea . The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .",3
"I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day .",3
"Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .",3
"Okay . Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?",6
"I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day .",4
If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend . It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun .,4
"Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something .",4
Sure . What is it ?,4
"I think you can give me some advice . You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think .",4
I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ?,4
I am worried about the meeting this morning .,5
Why ? I think the meeting went well .,4
Yes . But what are you worried about ?,4
I'm afraid I was too rude .,4
"Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ?",4
"Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry .",4
I understand . But really you weren't rude at all . You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that .,4
"But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that .",4
You mean because you are a woman ?,4
Yes . And he is the president of the company .,4
"Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond . He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all . He appreciates people for their ideas . And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women .",4
"I am very happy to hear that , Karen . It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company .",3
"I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs .",4
Good . Thank you for telling me this .,3
"Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up . This is a company that appreciates initiative .",4
Do you like music ?,4
"Well , it depends .",4
Do you think the music is well-matched ?,4
"No , I think the music is too fast .",4
How about the words of the song ?,4
It sounds nice .,4
I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings .,3
"Yes , I think so . It's very emotional .",3
"Of course , and I also like the rhythms .",3
Full of energy and hope .,3
Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying .,3
Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award .,3
My Goodness ! What a busy line so early in the morning ! Hello .,6
Ruth ? Basil .,4
"Hi , Basil .",4
Want a ride to the office ?,4
"Yes , by all means . I was just about to leave .",4
Hold on . Just 5 minutes .,4
I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you .,3
It's my pleasure . See you .,3
"Hi , Ruth . Hop in .",4
Do you mind if I take some notes while we drive ?,4
Of course I don't mind . For your report ?,4
"Yes , I finally have an inspiration .",3
"Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio",3
"Jimmy , I ' d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ?",4
Don ' t dress like that . You ' ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe .,1
What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing .,6
Maybe it is . But it ' s out of fashion .,1
What am I going to do ?,4
Let ' s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you .,4
"Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ?",4
"Sounds good , when ?",3
When is it convenient for you ?,4
Any time is fine .,4
Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ?,4
Please wait for us even if we're a little late .,4
Never mind . I'll be waiting for you .,3
See you then .,3
OK . Bye !,3
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !,0
"Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .",4
He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .,0
I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .,4
"I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .",0
Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss .,4
"Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .",4
"Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .",4
I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?,4
I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .,4
Bob !,6
Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ?,6
"Fine , just fine . And you ?",3
Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ?,3
Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .,4
Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ?,6
I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef .,4
You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking !,6
"Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it .",4
When did you change your mind ?,4
"After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family .",4
"I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ?",6
Yeah . I went to California to study .,4
Really ? How long did you stay there ?,6
I was there between 88 and 90 .,4
And what did you do after that ?,4
Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience .,4
I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain .,3
You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall .,3
I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child,3
Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking,3
"Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ' m Todd . How can I help you ?",3
Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ...,4
"It ' s okay sir , calm down . What happened ?",4
"I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black !",2
"Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus .",4
"I don ' t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ' m fine .",2
"No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ' s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans .",4
"Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? !",2
How did you spend the weekend ?,4
I went to a movie with my boyfriend .,4
Really ? How was it ?,6
"It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors .",3
"Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?",4
"Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving .",3
Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ?,3
The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you .,4
"Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .",4
It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .,3
"Come in , come in !",4
"Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ' t you meet me there ?",0
I thought we were supposed to meet HERE .,4
Don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ' t make sense to meet at the apartment .,0
I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .,4
Why don ' t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?,0
You ' re right . I am sorry . Let ' s go and watch the movie .,4
It ' s okay . I don ' t want to go now . We ' Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ' t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .,0
"Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there !",3
"Really ? Well , thanks for saying so .",6
"No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ?",3
Sure . Why not ?,3
"OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner .",3
OK .,3
"This is great , isn't it ?",3
It's the most fun I've had in years .,3
We should do this more often .,3
"Yes , we should .",3
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ?,4
"Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat .",4
Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied .,4
"Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation . The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment .",4
Okay ...,4
I don ' t want to beat around the bush so I ' m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go .,4
What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ' m fired ?,6
"I ' m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee !",4
What ! I resent that !,6
"Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol !",0
Excuse me . Is there any body here ?,4
I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water .,4
"Sure , come on in .",4
Thank you very much . Are you here alone ?,3
My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ?,4
I'm a back-packer from America .,4
What is a back-packer ?,4
It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world .,4
Cool . You must have been to a lot of places .,3
"Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places .",3
So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up .,3
You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier .,4
I'll try my best .,4
"So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?",4
"Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore .",1
That ' s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather .,1
"What ' s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ' t people do something to stop it ?",1
"It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ?",4
My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .,4
"Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?",4
"Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates .",4
What position do you play ?,4
I ' m a defender . It ' s a lot of fun . You don ' t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .,4
"Yeah , you ' re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself .",4
"Oh , yeah ? Which team ?",6
The Rockets .,4
"Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later .",6
"All right , see you later .",4
Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?,4
I heard it might rain .,4
Oh . That ' s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills .,4
Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead .,3
Yes that might be a better idea .,3
Maybe we ' ll meet some of the artists too .,3
Ok - let ' s do that then !,3
We'd like a half-day package .,3
We offer many different sea water treatments .,3
How many can we choose ?,3
The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three .,3
"We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage .",3
OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first .,3
"Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ?",4
"I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's",3
They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .,4
That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ?,3
"Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go",4
"That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night .",3
"Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too .",4
That does sound a lot of fun .,3
"I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks .",4
"Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that .",4
"Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .",3
Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .,3
"Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .",3
I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets .,3
"Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ?",3
Sure . What's playing ?,3
"Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ?",3
"Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress .",3
"Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas .",3
She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting .,3
"What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities .",3
Who is the director ?,4
Steven Spielberg . Another superstar .,3
"Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 .",3
Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ?,4
It tells a romantic and humorous love story .,4
This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one .,3
"No , it hasn't . It's very dirty .",1
Someone ought to clean it today .,4
Mark should clean it . It's his turn .,4
"No , he cleaned it last time . It's your turn .",4
"No , it isn't . You always clean it after Mark .",4
"Oh dear , is it really my turn ? In that case , I'll clean tomorrow .",6
Clean it now . Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow .,4
Then I'll clean it the day after tomorrow .,4
You are lazy . You ought to be ashamed ? You should enjoy working .,1
"Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ?",4
Do you have some new perfume ?,4
"I am sorry , madam . I didn't hear you . It's too noisy here . Could you please say it again ?",4
"Well , I wanna buy some new perfume .",4
Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once .,4
That's all right .,4
Here you are .,4
Can I open it ?,4
"Yes , certainly , madam .",3
It smells sweet .,3
"Yes , it is . This perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of Chanel .",4
Really ? How much is it ?,6
"55 dollars , madam .",4
"Ok , I will take two bottles .",4
Thank you . Do you need something else ?,3
"No , thanks .",3
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ?,0
"Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me .",4
"Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .",0
"Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William .",4
"Oh right ... present company excluded , of course !",0
Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go .,4
I'm sorry .,5
It isn't your fault . No one will blame you .,3
You are so thoughtful .,3
There's a new play tonight .,4
What's its name ?,4
' Romeo and Juliet ' .,4
What is it about ?,4
It's about their great love .,4
Sounds interesting .,3
Of course . Do you want to see it ?,3
"Yes , do you have tickets ?",4
"No , I don't .",4
"Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now , shall we ?",3
Good idea . Let's goa,3
OK . Let's go .,3
I can ' t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !,6
"Why not ! It ' s a classic ; in fact , it ' s one of my favorite novels .",6
But it ' s so old .,4
Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ' s about ?,4
"No , not at all .",4
"First of all , it ' s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .",4
I didn ' t realize it was a romance novel . What ' s the main storyline ?,4
It ' s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .,4
Why does he want to do that ?,4
"Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .",4
Won ' t they get his inheritance ?,4
"No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .",4
I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ' t so horrible after all .,3
"So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?",4
There ' s movie ? My teacher didn ' t tell me that !,6
That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .,4
It would take a lot less time ..,4
How about this . When you finish the book . I ' ll get the movie and watch it with you .,4
Ok . That sounds like a deal .,3
What ' s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ?,4
I feel itchy ! I can ' t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .,5
Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !,2
What ' s wrong ?,4
I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ' t breathe on me !,2
Maybe it ' s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ' t be sure until I see a doctor .,4
Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ' t get it when I was a kid and I ' Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !,2
"Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ' ll go take an oatmeal bath .",4
"It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system .",4
That's pretty advanced .,3
Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .,4
Is that where you park ?,4
"Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in .",4
Thank you . Where is your key ?,3
"There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .",4
"That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment .",6
Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out .,4
Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves .,3
"Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?",4
"Here it is , and here we are .",3
"When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .",4
"I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk .",3
How is your new car ?,4
Perfect . Couldn't be better .,3
Why do you say so ? Can I see your new car ?,4
Of course you can . ( Lead Carl to his garage . ),3
"Wow , this new car is dynamite ! It is a shiny , beautiful car .",3
My car is simply a daisy . It drives smoothly .,3
The car has very sleek lines . I love it .,3
I am glad to hear that . I'm really pleased with it .,3
You made a good choice .,3
Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ?,4
Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls .,4
That sounds good . Let me see one .,3
Here's the latest model -- Digital Barbie .,4
"Oh , she's nice . How much is she ?",4
"Why , she's only $ 29 . 95 .",4
"Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it .",4
Excellent . Would you like anything else ?,3
"No , thank you .",3
The total will be $ 32 . 42 . Will that be cash ?,4
"Oh , cash will be fine .",4
Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us .,3
Your knowledge of English is really surprising .,3
"Oh , it's nothing to speak of .",3
"No , seriously . I am impressed .",3
Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .,3
"Happy Birthday , Mary !",3
Thank you .,3
Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it .,3
What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ?,6
I had my own ways of finding out . It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .,3
"Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother .",3
Really ? It looks so nice .,6
"Thank you , Please have a cup of tea .",3
All right .,3
How about some fish ?,3
"No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake .",3
OK . Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ?,3
"No , just a small one . Next Let's sing "" Happy Birthday "" to Mary .",3
It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you .,3
"Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you .",3
"Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you .",3
"Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice .",3
"I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ?",3
They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon .,3
Let's go .,3
Please come in !,4
Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you .,4
"Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home .",3
OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful .,3
Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this .,3
She must have done a lot of work on it .,3
You bet .,3
Do you want to go shopping with me ?,3
That's a good idea . What time is good for you ?,3
How about Saturday morning ?,3
Sounds good .,3
I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .,3
Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain .,4
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?,4
What ? Why do we have to do that ?,6
"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .",4
"I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",0
"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !",4
"That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !",6
I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking .,0
"I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please .",5
"How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you .",0
"You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go .",5
It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility .,0
"I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you .",5
Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment .,0
I told you I happened to be more important meeting at that time .,4
I just don't trust you any more .,0
"hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?",6
part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?,4
"oh , it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?",4
"sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .",4
cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !,3
"yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .",4
that ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?,4
of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .,4
"you mean you got working experience , right ?",4
not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .,4
it must be very demanding .,4
"sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ' s easy to figure out .",4
really ? It sounds interesting .,3
maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .,4
great . I ' m looking forward to it .,3
"The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery .",3
This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ?,3
Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything,3
"No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there .",4
"Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first .",3
"Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds .",3
I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ?,3
"I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how .",3
They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ...,3
It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ?,4
"Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ?",4
"Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ?",4
"I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ?",4
Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work .,4
"OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ?",3
"Yeah , that's fine .",3
What's your number ?,3
233-331-8828 . Let me give you my email address too . It's Tom861@gmail . com,3
"OK , I'll talk to you soon .",3

Hi Martha . Everything is perfect .,3
Are you enjoying married life ?,4
It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much .,3
You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that .,3
"I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends .",3
Do you guys do anything special ?,3
"In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe .",3
Sound like everything is great .,3
Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance .,3
I'm glad I could help .,3
Here's the check . I included a little extra for you .,3
You didn't have to do that !,6
"I know , but you deserve it .",3
Good evening . Welcome to our program .,3
"Thank you . Good evening , Mr . Dean .",3
"Would you tell us your name , please ?",4

"Where are you from , Ms . Baker ?",4
I'm from New Zealand .,4
What do you do for a living ?,4
I'm a teacher .,4
"Thank you for coming , Ms . baker .",3
"Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ?",3
"All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ?",3

When is it ?,3
At 8P M tomorrow night .,3

Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment .,3
"Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ?",3
"Yes , that's right . You have a good memory .",3
I passed history test .,3
Really ? That ' s marvelous !,6
And then you ' re old man won ' t be beaten this time .,3
I ' Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again .,3
We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ?,3

Fine . See you then .,3
This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ?,3
"A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ' s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ' s take a drive .",3
"Okay then , let ' s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast .",3
Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly .,3
"Hey , just watch out for cops or you ' re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ?",4
"Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks .",4
Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car .,4
"Cut out , would you ?",4
I ' d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me .,3
It ' s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you .,3
I wouldn ' t be able to make it without your help .,3
Then keep up the good work .,3
I want to say goodbye to everyone .,4
You ' re leaving so soon . When are you off ?,4
I ' m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning .,4

You really don ' t need to .,3
Ok . I ' ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon .,3

I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen .,4
I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ?,4
Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan .,4
Do you have the bank card in Japan ?,4
Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries .,4
That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ?,3
No . It is free of charge .,4
Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later .,3
I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon .,4
"David , why didn ' t you clean the room ?",4
I ' m not in the mood .,5
Why are you feeling depressed ?,4
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ' s a real let-down .,5
I don ' t think she will do such a thing .,4
But she did and made me disappointed .,5
"Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything .",4
But she means a lot to me .,5
Then forgive her mistake .,4
Oh . I just can ' t forget it .,5
You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ' m headed for the holidays !,3

Really ? I think that's impossible !,6
You mean 30 push-ups ?,4
Yeah !,4

"Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ?",4

"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .",4
"Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .",4
To me English is a difficult language .,4
A second language is always difficult .,4
"True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language .",4
A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?,6
One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .,4
No wonder you say English is a crazy language .,4
Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you .,3
Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ' t miss something interesting .,4
"No , you are just on time . We haven ' t really started yet .",4

"Thank you , they ' re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ?",3
Don ' t bother . I will help myself .,4
Make yourself at home .,4
It is such a nice place .,3
"Well , I don ' t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen .",3
"David , why don't you clean your room ?",4
I am not in the mood .,5
Why are you feeling depress ?,4
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .,5
I don't think she would do such a thing .,4
But she did and it made me disappointed .,5
"Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything .",4
"Oh , I just can't forget it .",5
Do I need a visa ?,4
"No , I shouldn ' t think so . But you must take your passport of course .",4
"Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ' s check and some foreign currency .",4
"Yes , you need the traveler ' s check but you needn ' t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ' t need them .",4
"Really ? That ' s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing .",6
You needn ' t buy one . You can have mine .,3
"That ' s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ' t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ' t be long .",3
"Don ' t be silly , John . I ' m going with you . It ' s necessary for me to have a holiday too .",3
Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages !,6
Hi George ! It's good to see you !,6
What have you been up to ?,4
I just opened up my own business not long ago .,4
Good for you ! What are you doing ?,4
I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that .,4
I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun !,3
"Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun !",3
"Trina , will you marry me ?",3
"Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ' ll marry you !",3
"Oh , Babe , I can ' t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ' t wait for all the adventures we ' re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ' t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .",3
"Oh , Jared ! I can ' t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ' t mind , but I ' Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ' Ve had plenty of time to start planning !",3
She what ?,4
"Oh don ' t worry , sweetie , I didn ' t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ' Ve got it all planned out . There ' s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending .",4
Four hundred ?,4
"No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ' church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ' ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ' s going to be a professional opera singer ?",4
Ah ...,4
"And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ' ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ' s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !",4
Wow .,4
See ? It ' s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .,4
If I survive the next six months .,4
"Belinda , I ' m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ?",4
Is it formal or informal ?,4
I guess it ' s formal .,4
"Then , you should dress well .",4
That ' s right .,4
I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .,3
You are smart .,3
"Of course , the sports shoes don ' t go with the formal occasions .",4
You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ?,4
The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers .,3
"Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ?",3
It ' ll be too late ; you ' d better take a taxi .,4
How do you like Tom ?,3
I like him very much . He ' s a gay dog .,3
Are you ready to welcome him ?,3
I am all set . He can come anytime .,3
"Good evening , Mr . Wu .",3
"Good evening , Mr . Smith .",3
"Have you met my wife , Mary ?",3
No . I haven ' t had the pleasure .,3
"Mary , this is Mr . Wu , my new Chinese friend .",3
"How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome .",3
"Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests .",3
Have you bought War Craft 2 yet ?,4
Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released .,3
How do you like it ?,4
It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters .,4
Did it cost very much,4
It cost about thirty . Most games cost about that much .,4
Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome !,3
"Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game .",3
My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game .,4
"Yeah , my roommate likes to watch me play . He says it's like watching a movie .",4
I've never seen such good graphics .,3
And I've never heard such good sound in a game .,3
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ?,4
"How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it .",0
"It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke .",0
"Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .",0
"What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in .",4
What about the Yen ?,4
Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar !,6
"Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ?",4
I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation .,4
Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? !,4
Not very long from the looks of it !,1
Look ! He has a partner !,6
He's dancing with Jack !,6
Gross !,1
The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss .,4
But I think Eddy is going too far !,1
You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ...,4
Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt !,4
How embarrassing !,4
We're lucky today .,3
"Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace",3
Where's Hyde Park ?,4
It's on the other side of the Palace .,4
"That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays , isn't it ?",4
"Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen .",4
"Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there .",3
Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today .,3
Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating .,3
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ?,4
I don ' t know . I didn ' t really feel like going out . I guess I ' m feeling a little homesick .,5
"Come on . We ' Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it .",4
"I was . It ' s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ' t be able to home because I can ' t afford the airfare . I ' m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ' s cooking and being around my family .",5
"Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ' d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it .",4
"I see what you mean , but I ' m still bummed out .",5
OK . how does this sound . let ' s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !,4
"You know , I could really go for that . You don ' t mind being my wingman for tonight ?",3
Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ' night out ... well kinda ...,4
"Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ' t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ' s not a pretty picture !",4
I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday .,4
Let's plan a surprise party for him !,3
Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ?,3
That's easy . Anything else ?,3
"Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ?",4
Won't he be surprised !,3
I don't know how old he is though .,4
That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans !,4
"Hello , Mary . Nice day , isn't it ?",4
"Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end .",4
"I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time .",4
How about taking a walk in the park ?,3
OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .,3
"( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me .",4
Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right .,6
"Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people .",3
"Ah , you changed so fast .",4
"Hi , Mary , long time no see .",3
I heard through the grapevine that your getting married .,3
"Yes , next March .",3
"Congratulations , I hope everything works out .",3
Hey Jack . What's going on ?,4
Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ?,4
Really ? When did you decide this ?,6
"I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it .",4
"That's exciting , man .",3
So how did you propose ?,4
You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now .,4
What do you think I should do ?,4
"There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .",4
I never thought about that .,4
Thought about what ?,4
Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ?,4
I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .,4
"I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man .",3
Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it .,3
Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week .,3
"Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too .",3
How can we get there ?,3
We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station .,3
OK ! Let's go .,3
( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge .,3
"Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan .",4
"Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects .",4
Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas .,4
We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn .,4
It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ?,4
I really like the record you lent me the other day .,3
I'm glad you like it .,3
And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .,3
I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it .,3
I'm glad .,3
Would you mind my keeping it for another week ?,4
"Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week .",3
We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ?,3
"It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .",3
"Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person .",4
"Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !",3
"I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us .",4
"Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ?",4
What is that ?,4
A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper .,4
"I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ?",4
Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ?,4
Jake just broke up with me .,5
I'm sorry . When did this happen ?,4
Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else .,5
What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you .,4
But it still hurts . I thought I loved him .,5
"He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better .",4
"Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him",5
It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week .,4
I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive .,5
Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping .,4
Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight .,4
How about coffee down the street ?,4
Sure .,4
"Welcome to our university ' s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat .",3
"Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations !",3
Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?,4
"Certainly . Mr . Lee ' s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library .",4
Excuse me ?,4
Let me show you the way . Please follow me .,3
Thank you very much . It ' s very kind of you .,3
My pleasure .,3
This is it ?,4
It ' s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ' t working .,4
the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off .,3
that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines .,3
great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal .,3
do you prefer brandy or ports .,3
"port , please .",3
excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .,3
the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?,3
yes . You always have a good nose for wines .,3
next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .,3
"oh , what's that ?",3
it's made from naturally frozen grapes .,3
why not ? It sounds great .,3
"oh , here's to your health .",3
thanks . Cheers .,3
cheers .,3
How time flies !,3
May and Danny have already grown up .,3
I can still remember our first date .,3
Look at that big tree over there .,3
"Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there .",3
Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight .,3
You were dull at that time .,3
But you agreed to go out with me at last .,3
I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married .,3
Hello !,4
Is that the box-office ?,4
"I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please .",4
"Just a minute please . Oh , I'm sorry , all the tickets for tonight have been sold out .",4
What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ?,4
"Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ?",3
"Wonderful , I'll take them .",3
"OK , your name and telephone number please .",4
Wang Min . Telephone number is 13811658 . Can I pick the tickets this afternoon ?,4
"Yes , of course .",3
Thank you very much .,3
"Hello , Anna speaking !",4
"Hey , Anna , this is Jason .",4
"Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?",4
"Yes . How are you , Anna ?",4
I am fine . What have you been doing ?,4
Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .,4
"That's great , congratulations !",3
"Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .",3
That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .,3
You are kidding .,6
How long have you been working there ?,4
"A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ' t the only factor in deciding promotions .",4
How do you like your new boss ?,4
She is very nice and open-minded .,3
"Much better than the last one , huh ?",4
Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots .,3
Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk .,4
Good . Tonight 8 o'clock .,3
8 it is . See you then .,4
Bye .,3
"Hi Amy , you look very happy .",3
"Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony .",3
Wow . You must be very excited .,3
I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ' t got them .,3
Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ?,3
What a good idea . I'm quite hungry .,3
Me too . I feel very thirsty as well .,3
Let ' s go then .,3
"Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now .",3
"Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you .",3
"Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody .",4
"It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ?",4
Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family .,3
We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ?,3
About 4 .,3
OK . Do you want us to bring something ?,3
"No , just come here .",3
"OK , see you later .",3
"Mary , be calm .",4
It is impossible . You cheated on me .,0
"No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you .",4
Shut up !,0
"No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ...",4
"But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't .",0
OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same .,4
Leave me ! Go away !,0
"Dad , I'm scared .",2
"Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs .",4
"But , dad , it's stormy outside .",2
"Honey , it's just windy and raining outside .",4
"Ar ! Dad , the power went out .",2
How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ?,3
I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday .,4
"How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning .",3
I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well .,4
"Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most .",3
OK . I'll talk to you later .,3
Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ?,3
That would be fine . Where are you going ?,3
We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing .,3
Great .,3
And don't forget your fishing tackle .,3
Ok . I like fishing very much .,3
What did you think of the film ?,4
I liked it . I thought it was great .,3
"Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ?",3
Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ?,3
Not really . I thought it was disappointing .,1
"It's a nice cinema , isn't it ?",4
Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable .,1
"Ashley , what a great dinner party !",3
"Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water .",3
Just water would be fine .,3
Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ?,3
"Yes , the chicken looks wonderful !",3
How about some salad to go with your chicken ?,3
"Sure , I love salad !",3
Would you like to have rice with your chicken ?,3
"Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken !",3
"Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set .",3
Then I must go-you have said it yourself .,4
"No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept .",0
I tell you I must go !,0
Where ?,4
"I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now .",4
I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion .,0
I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return .,0
"Hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it .",4
Is it a horror movie ?,2
"Yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ?",4
No way . I will be scared out of my wits .,2
"That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .",3
"Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ?",3
"Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?",3
"Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on .",4
"That is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies .",4
Yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned .,4
Not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .,3
The Notebook is this type of movie .,4
Really ? I haven't heard of it .,6
"Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it .",3
Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go !,3
"Well , it was nice meeting you .",3
"Yes , I hope we meet again .",3
"Sure , I'll give you a call .",3
Okay .,3
Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ?,3
"No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more .",3
I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ?,3
"I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack .",3
You are welcome .,3
"Hello , could you arrange a dinner for us ?",4
"Sure , what time ?",3
Eight o'clock tomorrow evening .,4
For how many people ?,4
Ten .,4
Western food or Chinese food ?,4
Chinese food .,4
Do you want an expensive meal ?,4
"No , not too lavish .",4
How much would you like to spend for each person ?,4
What is the usual thing here ?,4
Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate .,4
Let's say sixty Yuan then .,4
OK . Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu ?,4
We'd like to have typical Chinese food .,4
Anything you'd rather not have ?,4
"No snakes , please .",4
How about drinks ?,4
Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer .,4
"Well . Dinner for ten at sixty Yuan a plate , drink's extra , at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening . Is that all right ?",4
"Right , thanks .",3
"My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening .",3
Would you like to stretch your legs ?,3
Sure .,3
Let's get a soft drink .,3
Do we have enough time ?,4
It's a fifteen-minute intermission .,4
The seats are excellent . We're right in the center .,3
It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .,3
I can't agree more .,3
Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?,4
"In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents .",4
Do you have large concert halls in your city ?,4
We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller .,4
"That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start .",3
Did you see Ally Mabel last night ?,3
"Yes , I did . Did you ?",3
"Yes , wasn't it funny ?",3
"Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ?",3
"Ha , yes , brilliant !",3
"Well , I am a regular member of this club .",4
Do you have to pay to join ?,4
"Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars .",4
"Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ?",6
"Very few , unfortunately .",4
How was your game today ?,4
"Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies !",3
Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ?,3
Ten . How did your game go ?,4
My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps .,5
Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again .,4
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ?,3
I'd enjoy that .,3
I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .,3
OK . I'll see you then .,3
"Jenny , are you having fun here ?",3
"Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .",3
I ' m glad you ' re enjoying it .,3
Thank you for the invitation .,3
It ' s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ?,3
"Yes , please . Thank you for everything .",3
"Hey , what's up ?",4
"Oh , nothing .",4
What were you writing ?,4
( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk .,3
You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !,4
I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person .,3
"But , you work with her everyday .",4
"That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red .",3
You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ?,4
"Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea .",3
"Well , I guess you don't want this note , then .",4
What note ?,4
I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .,4
You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything .,6
"Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ?",3
"Yeah , I want the note .",3
Have a great time tomorrow night .,3
Thanks . I plan on it .,3
"Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather .",0
Yes . And they don ' t give you very much either . I ' m still hungry .,0
I ' m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant .,0
Don ' t do this ! Don ' t do that ! You mustn ' t do this ! You can ' t do that !,0
"Well , I ' m going to write a letter of complaint .",0
And we ' ll all help you .,0
How do you like this waltz ?,3
It's very nice . I like it very much .,3
"Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ?",3
"My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often .",3
"Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I only took up dancing quite recently .",6
"Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .",6
I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner .,3
Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ?,3
Yes . And what dances do you like best ?,3
"Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing .",3
"Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .",3
"Good morning , Mei ! How are you ?",3
"Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ?",3
Not bad thanks .,3
Good . See you !,3
Bye !,3
"You ' re going to set up your own law office , aren ' t you ?",4
"Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ' d rather I had an office of my own .",3
"If you need help , don ' t hesitate to ask me .",3
I ' ll be very glad if you would help .,3
I ' d like to wish you every success in your new venture .,3
Thank you . I wish I would .,3
Good luck to you .,3
That was heaven !,3
The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you .,3
But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body .,4
"Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed !",3
"It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters .",3
What do you mean by that ?,4
"Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions .",3
You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything .,4
"Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?",4
I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .,4
"Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?",3
That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .,3
"I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .",3
And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .,3
"Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .",3
Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !,3
"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",3
"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",4
"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",4
Me too .,4
"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",4
"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",4
"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .",3
"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",4
And the host announced that he won it all !,3
"Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside .",4
"Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .",4
"Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .",4
"Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much .",3
"My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before .",3
"Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town !",4
"Well , thanks for the suggestions .",3
"Oh , don't mention it .",3
Happy Valentine's Day !,3
That's nice of you .,3
Could I treat you to dinner tonight ?,3
Wonderful .,3
Guess what came in the mail today ?,3
My acceptance letter to Yale !,3
Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?,3
"Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .",3
You ' re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?,3
"Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes .",4
When can you do that ?,4
"Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?",4
Sure . What can you choose from ?,4
"Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .",4
What is your major ?,4
"I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ' ll see .",4
What are the fundamental course ?,4
"In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art .",4
Interesting . That ' s very different from the Chinese education system .,4
"Yes , it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .",4
"oh , sure . In British , students don ' t have to take the foundation course .",4
why not ?,4
maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .,3
It was great meeting you .,3
Me too .,3
Maybe we can meet again sometime ?,3
"Of course , but I'll have to go now .",3
I ' Ve had it ! I ' m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !,0
So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?,4
"That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !",0
Have you ever written up a business plan before ?,4
"Well , no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?",0
"You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .",4
"Well , that seems easy enough .",4
"Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .",4
Geez . Is that all ?,4
"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !",4
Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !,3
I've enjoyed conversing with you .,4
Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ?,0
I've got to go .,4
I wasn't done talking to you .,0
"I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey .",0
I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking .,4
I really don't think it's any of your business .,0
That's not nice .,0
"I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now .",4
Okay .,4
Who's that tall guy over there ?,4
"Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk .",4
What's he like normally ?,4
"Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems .",4
Really ? What kind of problems ?,6
"Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well .",4
"Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised .",4
Really ? What makes you say that ?,6
"Well , he doesn't look very honest .",4
"I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ?",4
"Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them .",4
"Oh , really ?",4
"Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ?",3
"Yes , I'll have another cocktail .",3
Vodka martini ?,3
Absolutely .,3
I'll be back in a sec .,3
OK . I'll wait here for you .,3
"How do you like your job here , Linda ?",4
"It's interesting , I like being an editor .",3
"I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people .",3
"I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring .",3
I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry .,3
Do you have any complaints ?,4
"No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?",4
"Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .",3
That's perfect . I will definitely do well .,3
"Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on .",3
"Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said .",3
"Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .",3
I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .,3
"No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?",3
I got it on sale down at the department store .,4
When did you go there ?,4
"I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .",4
I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ?,4
Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles .,4
I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .,4
That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated .,4
"Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties .",4
"Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?",4
"Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?",4
I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .,4
Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans .,4
I guess that you will really be dressing down .,4
That's my style when I'm not in the office .,4
Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .,3
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !,3
There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ?,3
Vanilla with toppings is my favorite .,3
Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?,4
No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?,4
I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .,4
"I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me .",4
I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .,4
I think that would be horrible !,1
I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !,3
"Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ?",4
There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it .,5
Why ? We can leave school earlier that day .,4
"I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up .",5
I can't believe it . My parents never beat me .,6
You know that my father is irritable .,5
You can ask the teacher for help .,4
Good idea .,4
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking .,3
Yes . I like it very much .,3
"Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it .",4
It's excellent .,3
Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it .,4
It's delicious .,3
What sort of western food do you like best ?,4
I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?,4
I find the Chinese dishes wonderful .,3
"Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night .",4
It's still early .,4
"Hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ?",4
"Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well .",3
You're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink .,4
Should I take my shoes off ?,4
Whatever you prefer .,4
This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?,3
Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?,4
"Sure , what do you have ?",4
"I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .",4
I'll have a glass of red wine please .,4
One glass of red wine coming up !,3
So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?,4
There's just going to be 6 of us tonight .,4
"Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?",6
Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well .,4
That's too bad . They ' re such good company .,5
I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that .,4
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .,6
"Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet .",4
Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .,4
"That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .",4
What do you know ? You are over weight too .,4
I'm not on a diet though .,4
"I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .",4
I like ice cream too much though .,4
C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .,4
It does sound appealing .,4
It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .,3
Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .,3
Great . I'll get our plan started right away .,3
Can we start tomorrow though ?,4
You ' re making my blood boil .,0
Calm down . Madam .,4
I'm about to explode ! You ' Ve made a mess of this matter .,0
I am very sorry to hear that you ' Ve been having so many problems .,4
Sorry isn ' t good enough ! What can you do to help me ?,0
"I understand why you ' re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out .",4
"Well , obviously , what you ' re doing is not good enough !",0
"If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out .",4
It's late . It ' s high time I left . Thank you for a most wonderful evening .,3
Don't mention it .,3
Good night then !,3
Good night !,3
"Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now !",2
Is everything OK ?,4
Just get over here !,2
Come in ! Quickly !,2
"So , since when is your house a bank ?",4
"I mean , what ' s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .",4
"Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window .",2
What ' s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ?,4
"Paranoid ? I ' m not paranoid ! I ' m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis .",2
"OK , well , what did you want to see me about ?",4
You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful !,2
Hey Mark . What are you doing ?,4
Just watching some TV .,4
Anything interesting on ?,4
Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN .,4
So I take it you're pretty bored too .,4
Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ?,4
It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ?,4
You wanna shoot some hoops ?,4
"I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy .",4
Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today .,4
She's out shopping with her friends .,4
Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then .,3
Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?,3
I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way .,4
Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes .,3
Aright . See you there .,3
Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ?,3
I'd love to .,3
Which day would suit you ?,3
Any day except Tuesday .,4
How about Thursday ?,4
"Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ?",4
"Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ?",4
"Yes , of course . Thank you very much .",3
"See you on Thursday , then .",3
Will you be done doing my hair soon ?,4
Give me a little while longer .,4
How much time do you need ?,4
There you go . How do you like it ?,3
I think it looks gorgeous .,3
You think it looks nice ?,3
I honestly think it looks great .,3
Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job .,3
How much is it for my hair ?,3
Just give me $ 55 .,3
Thanks for doing such a good job .,3
"No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time .",3
"Hot in here , isn't it ?",4
"Yeah , really .",4
Is it Ok if I sit here ?,4
Of course . Suit yourself .,4
"Thanks . My name's Bill Peters , by the way .",3
"Hi , I'm Susan Jackson .",4
"Nice to meet you . And what do you do , Susan ?",4
I'm a student at UCLA .,4
"Oh , are you ? And what are you studying ?",4
Medicine .,4
"Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ?",4
"I'm an engineer , I work for Boeing . Say , would you like a drink ?",3
Sure . Thanks .,3
"Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ?",4
"Well , I have the day off from work .",4
That ' s great ! Do you have any plans ?,3
"Well , I ' Ve been working so hard lately , so I ' ll probably just take it easy .",3
Sounds nice .,3
"Yeah , I ' ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies .",3
Can I stop by ?,3
Sure . Any time .,3
We've got a new manager in our department .,4
"Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ?",4
"Yes , I did .",4
"I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ?",4
"Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too",4
Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ?,4
"Because I'm the wrong sex , of course !",0
You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ?,4
"Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair .",0
What sort of clothes does he wear ?,4
A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ?,4
Perhaps that had something to do with it .,4
You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ?,4
"It's possible , isn't it ?",4
Do you really think I should wear different clothes ?,4
Well . . . perhaps you should think about it .,4
Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ?,0
I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all !,4
Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing !,0
Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company .,4
Welcome back ! How was your vacation ?,3
"It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !",3
Where did you end up going ?,3
"Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there .",3
I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?,3
That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?,3
Sure . What's this one a picture of ?,4
"Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .",4
You don't look very happy in that picture .,4
"No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !",4
So what did you do ?,4
"We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .",3
My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?,3
Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .,3
That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .,3
Your search on this project has been excellent .,3
Thank you . I couldn ' t have done it without the help of a strong team .,3
The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .,3
"Well , I hope the client feels the same way !",3
I am sure they will be pleased .,3
I want to say ...,4
Say it ! What is it ?,4
That I can't go on any longer without you .,5
You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this .,6
"Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight .",4
Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it .,6
Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments .,5
Stop it . No more of that talk .,4
I really love you .,3
"No , I shall faint .",6
"And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes .",3
Yes .,3
I don ' t know what I ' m going to do ! It ' s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !,4
Don ' t worry . I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake .,4
"It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .",4
"But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .",4
"That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth .",4
Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?,4
I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow .,4
"Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?",4
Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .,4
"Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .",3
That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work .,3
"If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .",3
I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !,3
"Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again .",3
Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day .,3
Thank you . Can I meet my colleagues ?,3
"Sure , come with me . Hello , Michael , this is Steven . He will be part of your team .",4
"Hi , Steven , welcome to join us !",3
I ' Ve been looking forward to meeting you . I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance .,3
That ' s right . Just call me if you need anything .,3
That's great .,3
"Well , as the other guys are still not in , I ' ll introduce you to them later .",4
All right .,4
You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are !,0
Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident .,4
Sure . You look like you're all black and blue .,0
"I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition .",4
You're serious ?,6
"Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert .",5
I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me .,4
"Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ?",4
"Mary , today is a great day for you .",3
How nice of you to remember !,3
"Oh , here's a little token of my affection .",3
You're so thoughtful . Thank you .,3
How was the party yesterday ?,4
Did you enjoy it ?,4
"Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had .",1
Why ! what happened ?,6
"Well . John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind .",1
So how long did you stay ?,4
I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there .,1
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?,6
I'm sorry . I forget all about it .,5
How could you ? I reminded you just this morning .,0
It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it .,5
I have been looking forward to this performance all month .,5
I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow .,5
May I take your order now ?,4
"Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ?",4
Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .,4
The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?,4
"Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .",4
"Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar .",4
"Then , how about this one ?",4
OK . I'll have that .,4
Very good . Could I serve you anything else ?,3
Thank you . That's enough .,3
"My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch .",3
Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders .,4
"Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again !",3
"We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !",3
"not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black .",3
The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .,4
"I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field .",4
Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .,3
Let's hope it is !,3
"Hi ! Ed , what's up ?",4
Maybe I can help .,4
I blew the finally exam .,4
You've got to be joking .,6
"Hello , Rachel . It's glad to see you here .",3
"Hi , Ross . Glad to see you , too .",3
I'm going to throw a party tomorrow night . Would you like to come ?,3
A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ?,3
Of course .,3
That's great ! What time will it start at ?,3
At 6 o'clock .,3
OK . I'll come . See you then .,3
"Judy , your husband has a really nice car .",3
"Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new .",3
Where are you going ?,4
We're going to visit my sister in the city .,4
"I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ?",4
"About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library .",4
"I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ?",4
"Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes .",4
"Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway .",4
"I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now .",4
Doesn't your mother live in the city ?,4
"Yes , she's lived there for about ten years .",4
I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then .,4
I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now .,4
"Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker .",4
See you later .,4

What else do you like to do besides watching movies ?,4
"I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool .",4
Out of those what is your favorite ?,4
My favorite is to play computer games .,4
What is your favorite computer game ?,4
"My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old .",4
"If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ?",4
"Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week .",4
"That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ?",3
I am going to go to the bookstore .,4
"I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come .",3
That sounds like fun .,3
Great . I'll see you on Saturday .,3
Ok . See you later .,3
Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in .,4
Where else haven't we been to yet ?,4
They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls .,4

"Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors .",4

I ' ll just have to wait for UCLA .,4

"I've tried , but it didn't work .",4
"So , when are you going to tell her ?",4
Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her .,5
I know she ' s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt !,4
I know ...,4
"Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ?",4
I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam .,3
You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ?,6
That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier .,3
Did you tell your parents yet ?,4
Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight .,4
They're probably going to be so happy .,3
I think so . It's turning out to be a great day .,3
ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ?,4
just after 2 am .,4
what's wrong ? Can't sleep ?,4

I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ?,4
I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ?,6

How nice it is here,3
You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ' s pleasant raise . it ' s so lovely,3
"I ' Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year",3
That ' s correct . we have four seasons of spring,3
Where is Pamela ?,4
Is she coming ?,4
She told me she'd be here .,4
They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane .,4
Are you rushing me ?,4
"I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ?",4
I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ?,4
Name it and I'll do it for you .,4
Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything .,4
I've got it .,4
Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time .,3
I am just doing what I think I should do .,3
Thank you for being a friend of mine .,3
"This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business",3
"Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her .",4
"Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum .",3
Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ?,3
"I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting .",3
I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum .,3
Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be .,3
Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry .,3
Good idea .,3
( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?,3
I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map,3
"Sure , take your time . We have a whole day .",3
It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece .,3
Look at the museum guide . It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide .,3
Oh !,4
What fools we were !,5
To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me .,4
And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most .,4
"What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves .",5
I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us .,4
"I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ?",0
And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot .,0
Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ?,3
Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight .,3
When's the wedding going to be ?,3
"We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know .",3
Are you having a big wedding ?,3
"Yes , I've always dream of having a big wedding .",3
But what do you say about that ?,3
"I don't really enjoy big occasions , but I think I ' ll come round to the idea in the end , It only happens once in a lifetime .",4
Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before .,4
"Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ?",4
"Speaking . Who's calling , please ?",4
"Hi , Mary . This is Tom .",4
"Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ?",4
Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ?,4
"Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free .",3
"Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ?",3
Sounds like a good idea .,3
Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 .,3
"Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom .",3
"Good morning , Mr . Jones !",3
"Good morning , Miss Bell !",3
Nice to see you again .,3
Nice to see you too . It's been a long time .,3
How is everything ?,4
"Just fine , and you ?",4
"Quite well , thank you .",3

"No , I was driven by my husband .",4
Did someone meet you at the airport here ?,4
"Yes , thanks .",3
Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ?,4
"No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor .",4
"Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ?",3
Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten .,3
It's nice of you to say so .,3
I really appreciate you for having invited me .,3
"Don't mention it . You know , we ' re old friends .",3
"Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ?",3
Yes . Why ?,3
I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook .,3
That ' s great . I'd love to .,3
What a wonderful game !,3
"Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful .",3
I think John is the best player on the field .,3
He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage .,3
"Maybe he shouldn ' t come to collage , he should become a football star .",3
isn't it wonderful walking here ?,3
what do you mean ?,3
I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .,3
"yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .",3
it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?,3
"you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .",3
what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?,3
quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St . Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark,3
what's there after that ?,3
"well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .",3
what are all they for ?,3
"most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .",3
"Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last .",3
"Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling .",3
Are you OK today ?,3
Quite good except thinking of you so much .,3
So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind .,3
"It's called love is blind , I think .",3
"Hurry up , get in .",4
"I ' m in , let ' s go !",4
"OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up !",4
Geez ! What ' s the rush ?,4
"Don ' t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it !",4
Are you nuts ! I ' m not going to run a red light !,6
"Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ' s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move !",0
What ' s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help !,0
"Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ' ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ' s go , let ' s go ! Watch out for that lady !",4
I ' m going as fast as I can !,4
"Yes ! We made it . 5 fifty-eight , just before the library closes .",3
You ' re such a geek !,4
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots .,0
It was me . I am so sorry .,4
What did you think you were doing ?,0
"I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through .",5
How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong .,0
I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much .,5
Never do that again .,4
I promise .,4
We ' re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ?,3
Sure . I ' Ve never seen a dragon boat race .,3
Really ? I think you ' ll love it .,6
As long as I don ' t have to row .,3
"So Alex , you ' re off to the Olympic stadium then ?",4
"Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ' s 400m relay .",4
"Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there .",3
"Yes , I ' m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump .",3
Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can .,3
"Ok , I ' ll try my best .",3
Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ' d like to sign up for my courses for next semester .,4
"Yes , of course . I need your student ID please .",4
"Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ?",4
Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .,4
Sure . That ' s not a problem . Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ?,4
Yeah . Here ' s my list . I ' m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .,4
"Yeah , that ' s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?",4
"Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .",4
"Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ' ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start .",6
"Hi , John ! How was your vacation ?",4
We went to Malaysia and Thailand .,4
That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?,4
Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia .,3
"Wow , isn't that dangerous ?",4
"A little , but the rush was worth it .",3
Tell me about it .,4
We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .,4
500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .,6
"Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating .",3
"Another glass of beer , will you ?",3
"Thanks , I'm enough .",3
At least one for your trip .,3
I'll have it if you insist .,3
"Happy birthday , Aims !",3
"Thank you , Lisa .",3
Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .,3
"Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .",3
I'm very glad to hear that .,3
Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you .,3
"Dad , why are you taping the windows ?",4
"Honey , a typhoon is coming .",4
"Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow .",6
"Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food .",4
OK . Dad ! I'm coming .,4
you're rather energetic today . What's going on ?,4
nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees .,4
"free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ?",4
it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ?,4
not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today .,4
why is that ?,4
my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend !,0
"your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ?",4
you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work !,0
that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office .,4
really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy .,6
maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all !,4
"no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T .",4
try not to let it bother you too much .,4
thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again !,4
"ok , I'll see you in a bit .",4

This next one is from Betty .,3
"A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !",3
One more from Carla .,3
A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !,3
"OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?",4
Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !,2
"Mom , Happy mother's Day ! Here's my card .",3
What a surprise ! Thanks . It ' s beautiful .,3
"Thank you for your love and care over the years , I appreciate it , mom .",3
This is the best card I ever received .,3
"Mom , what can I do for you today ?",4
"Nothing , son . I'm already very happy .",3
How about dinner tonight ? My treat .,3
Actually . I prefer we eat at home . We ' ll have more time to catch up that way .,3
"I'm sorry I haven't dropped in that much these past few years . Business kept me too busy , I apologize .",4
"Oh , don't mention it . I'm proud of you !",3
"Thank you , mom . I love you so much !",3
"It's very nice , I like it very much .",3
"Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently .",6

Thank you for your compliments . It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ?,3
Yes . And what dances do you do best ?,3

My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .,3
Fine .,3
What's taking you so long ?,4
Don't worry . I'm almost finished .,4
I need you to hurry up .,4

I think there's more you need to do .,1
My hair looks awful .,1
What don't you like about it ?,4
I just don't like my hair .,1
I'm sorry that you don't like it .,4
I won't be paying you for this .,0
I'm sure we can work something out .,4
"Excuse me , is this the Guyon Travel Agency ?",4
"Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?",4
I want to travel to the ancient town in the south of China . Would you please tell me something about it ?,4
"Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense .",4
"Wonderful . That's just what I expect , where is my first place if I go there ?",4
Zhouzhuang .,4
How long does the tour take ?,4
It's about two days .,4

"Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming .",3
Sounds great !,3
"Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room .",3
Do you mean it ? I'd love to !,3
This is my favourite restaurant .,3
It looks very nice and the food looks delicious .,3
"Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before .",3
"Oh yes . Like this , for example . Have you ever eaten jellyfish before ?",4
"No , I haven ' t . I have never eaten jellyfish before .",4
What about these ? Have you ever tried pig ' s brains ?,4
"No , I have not and I ' m not sure I want to try them now .",4
"Hey , Taxi . Over here !",4
Did you call for a car service,4
"Yes , are you engaged",4
Not at the moment . Where would you like me to take you,4
"I am going to the airport , and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York .",4
"Well , it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway . I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour .",4
But I can't miss the flight . It's an important meeting and it ' s waiting for me .,4

I ' m not crazy about it at all .,1
You don ' t like this sort of exercise ?,4
I ' m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ?,1
"Yes , that ' s funny . I thought you liked it .",4
I hate it .,1
Never mind . It ' ll be over in 10 minutes .,4
It ' s the worst thing I ' Ve ever tried .,1
"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is .",4
"hey , Isabelle ...",4
Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .,6

what a bummer ! You set me up ?,0
let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...,4
how dare you !,0
"hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !",4
why did you lie to me in the email ?,4
I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .,4
I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .,4
"I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .",4

"Ok , here is $ 50 . Oh , can you make out an invoice for me ?",4

Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ?,3
"I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players .",4
"Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future .",6
I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ?,3
"Yes , I'd love to . It ' s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .",3
"I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .",3
Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?,3
"I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .",3
You ' re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ' s you favourite award category ?,3
"You might think this strange , but I like the category for "" best foreign language film "" .",3
"It ' s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the "" best actor and actress "" .",3
"Steven , why are you so depressed ?",4
I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper .,4
What's the news ?,4
"According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake .",4
It's horrible .,4
"Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area .",4
Yes . How about donating some money ?,3
It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ?,3
Just find the answer through Internet .,3
"Yes , let's do it now .",3
"Mr . Bellow , have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions ?",4
I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails .,4
Would you prefer our cocktail -- Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients .,3
That ' s good .,3
"( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow .",3
"Thank you . Oh , it tastes excellent .",3
You shouldn't have told her the truth . What can we do now ?,0
"I'm sorry , It's all my fault .",4
You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her .,0
"Sorry , I had no intention .",4
"It's too late to say sorry now . Oh , what am I going to do ?",0
"I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me .",4
"How is your job search 1 going , Janet ?",4
I found the ideal position . I ' m working for a plumbing company .,4
"Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !",6
"Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job .",3
I can see that . But I didn ' t know you had experience in that line of work .,4
"I didn ' t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted .",3
Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude .,3
"How are you doing , Christopher ?",4
"To be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !",4
Are you doing anything this weekend ?,4
I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !,0
Are you available on Sunday ?,4
"Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .",3
"Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?",3
That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?,3
It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .,3
What should I bring with me ?,3
"We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .",3
I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .,3
Do you like surfing ?,3
I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ?,3
We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !,3
I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?,3
"You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .",3
"Ok , where and when should I meet you ?",3
We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !,3
"Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ?",3
"Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report .",4
"Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ?",3
"No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ?",4
I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ?,3
"Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn .",4
All right ! Thanks !,3
"We have a holiday next week , don't we ?",4
"Yes , on Monday .",4
What're you going to do ?,4
I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .,4
"At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ?",0
"Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more .",4
"But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ?",0
"Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days .",4
"But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ?",0
"A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets .",4
A funny thing happened to me the other day .,3
"Oh , yes ?",4
"I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again .",3
Mmm .,4
"Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him .",3
"Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was .",3
"Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens .",3
"You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade !",3
Would you honor us with a visit ?,3
I'd love to . Thanks .,3
When will you be convenient ?,3
Any time will suit me .,3
Are you doing anything tomorrow ?,3
I'm free tomorrow .,3
"I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ?",3
"All right , see you then .",3
I'm so glad to meet you .,3
How is everything going on ?,3
You look prettier than before .,3
Really ? Thank you .,6
Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ?,4
Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now .,4
"No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually .",4
Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ?,3
"My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ...",3
I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights .,3
"Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope .",3
What sports do you like to play ?,4
I like baseball and basketball .,4
How about football ?,4
"In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger .",4
It's a very popular game in America .,4
Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ?,4
"For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .",4
Are you a football player ?,4
"No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football .",4
What is two hand touch and flag football ?,4
"Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .",4
I see . It's safer then right ?,4
"Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .",3
I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .,3
Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning .,3
"Hi , Daisy !",4
Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again,4
I hope you are Settling in at school !,3
I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses .,3
Good ! Me too ! By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here .,4
Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies .,4
Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ?,6
Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really .,4
What about your friend Zoe,4
She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy .,4
Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures .,6
"I guess so . What about you , Simon ?",4
I'm studying law .,4
Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer .,3
"Sure , welcome anytime",3
How have you been ?,3
"Fine , thank you .",3
And how ' s everyone in your family ?,3
"Very well , thank you . I ' m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ?",3
I ' d love to but I ' m afraid I can ' t . I ' Ve already got a lunch engagement .,3
What did you do last night ?,4
I just stayed at home and watched TV .,4
Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?,4
"Yes , it was a very evenly matched game .",4
What were the results of the game ?,4
It ended in a tie .,4
What was the actual score ?,4
It was three all .,4
Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .,6
"If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .",4
"Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .",4
That explains it .,4
How many more games are left this season ?,4
That was the last game before the playoffs .,4
When do the playoffs start ?,4
In a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?,4
Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .,3
"Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .",3
"Sure , that would be great .",3
"Ok , it's a date then !",3
"Jack , I hear you got promoted . Is that true ?",3
Yes . I think I'm lucky .,3
"Oh , Jack , you deserve it . You ' Ve been working so hard .",3
Thank you for saying that .,3
"David , would you like something to eat ?",3
"No , I'm full .",4
Do you want something to drink ?,3
"Yes , I'd like some coffee .",3
"Sorry , I don't have any coffee .",4
That's OK . I'll have a glass of water .,3
"A small glass , or a big one ?",3
Small please .,3
Here you are .,3
You're welcome .,3
Whoa ! This is a massive flea market !,3
You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here .,3
And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff .,3
This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it !,3
"You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan .",3
"Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings !",3
"I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away .",4
I knew this would happen some day .,4
"Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ?",0
"Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too .",4
I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life !,0
I think we can still talk .,4
No way ! Please don't follow me around .,0
"Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ?",4
"Yes , I do . Leave me alone !",1
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment .,1
What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ?,4
"He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .",1
Don ' t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ' t be so bad ...,4
"You ' re missing the point . It ' s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ' s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words .",1
That ' s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ' ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ' t be able to change him .,4
"Hi , long time no see . How have you been ?",4
"Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son .",5
Tell me all about it .,4
"Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd .",5
"Oh , I see . What makes you think that ?",4
"Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew .",5
Really ? What happened ?,6
He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home .,5
I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ?,4
I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through .,4
"You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life .",4
"You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to .",3
"I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime .",3
Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China .,3
And I must thank you again for your generous help .,3
"The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ?",3
I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards .,3
It must be old .,3
At least more than 100 years old .,3
Let's enter it !,3
It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?,2
Frightened ? You must be joking .,4
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?,1
"I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .",1
"Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .",1
"I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .",1
You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything .,4
Thank you for coming to see me off .,3
"If have time , I'll come again .",3
You're welcome at any time .,3
Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay .,3
You're most welcome .,3
I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon .,4
Call us as soon as you get home .,4
Can we talk ?,4
"Sure , honey , we ' re talking now , aren ' t we ?",4
You know what I mean .,4
Yeah . I know .,4
I want to know where this relationship is going . I ' m in love with you and I need to know ...,4
"You know , I think you ' re awesome .",4
"I ' m awesome . Well , I guess that ' s my answer , isn ' t it .",4
Honey ...,4
"Look , if you don ' t love me , it ' s not a thing , alright , we ' Ve had our laughs , but I don ' t appreciate ... maybe it ' s just time we ...",5
"Baby , I love you so much .",3
You do ?,3
I love you . And I think you ' re awesome .,3
"Oh , I love you too !",3
Come on . Put the gun down .,3
"Oh baby , I ' m so sorry .",3
"Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?",4
umm ... yeah ! I ' m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ' s next Friday .,4
"Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ?",3
"No , not really ... I ' m completely at a loss .",4
"Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ?",4
That purple one . I ' m sorry ... I ' Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ' m kind of nervous .,4
"Don ' t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ' s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ' s a great statement piece .",4
"Oh ... wow . That ' s really pretty . Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ?",4
"We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece -- it ' s both glamorous yet functional . If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her .",4
"Jess ? Well , she ' s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ' s very feminine ...",4
Perhaps you could give her a ring ?,4
Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ' Ve just been so nervous .,4
"Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !",3
"Okay , I ' Ve decided . I ' m going to pop the question !",3
Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ' s a whole other section .,3
I have just had my new paper published .,3
You have done excellent work .,3
I'm going to Britain .,4
Really ? How did you get the chance ?,6
I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD .,3
My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University .,3
I really appreciate your kind words .,3
how was your day ?,4
let ' s start with you . How was yours ?,4
it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break .,4
did you get to leave early then ?,4
"my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time .",4
it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that .,4
let ' s get back to you . How was your day ?,4
it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another .,5
you look pretty upset . Are you ok ?,4
I ' m fine . But I have bad news .,5
what ' s that ?,4
I got sacked today .,5
you ' re kidding ! How did that happen ?,6
"well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week .",4
how late were you ?,4
only about 5 minutes .,4
you got fired for being a few minutes late ?,4
"my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time .",4
"oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ?",4
"Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor .",3
"Yes , we're all proud of her !",3
"Here's to you , Mary !",3
Cheers !,3
I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ?,3
Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ?,3
It's at 8: 00 .,4
"That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ?",3
"Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late .",4
"Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 .",3
That sounds fine .,3
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?,3
Let's say about 6:00 ?,3
That's OK with me .,3
"Isn ' t he the best instructor ? I think he ' s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ' t you ?",3
"I swear , I ' m going to kill you for this .",1
What ' s wrong ? Didn ' t you think it was fun ? !,6
"Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ' m just not into this health kick .",1
"Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ' t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain .",0
I am wiped out . Thank you .,1
"Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ' re gonna come back again with me , aren ' t you ?",4
Never ! But thank you for inviting me .,1
Come on . You ' ll feel better after we hit the showers .,4
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?,4
Next Saturday ? I ' m sorry . I ' Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter .,4
How about Sunday then ?,4
"Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?",3
Does six thirty suit you ?,3
It suits us fine . We ' ll see you then .,3
"Thanks , goodbye .",3
Do you want to go to the beach tonight ?,3
"Sure , which beach are we going to ?",3
I wanted to go to Malibu beach .,4
I like Santa Monica .,4
The water there looks so dirty .,1
I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica .,4
"I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night .",3
Is Malibu beach nice ?,4
"It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better .",4
So you want to go to Malibu ?,3
If that's okay with you .,3
"Sure , let's go to Malibu .",3
"Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought .",3
"You ' re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football .",4
"Oh , right . So , I can ' t quite follow what ' s going on ... who ' s winning ?",3
"The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .",3
Wow ! What a hit !,6
"Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .",3
Is he ok ?,4
"It looks like it , he ' s getting up .",4
I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .,4
The Giants ?,4
Yeah .,4
"Well , here we go again .",4
What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?,4
The Redskin ' s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ' re losing again .,4
"Many happy returns of the day , darling ?",3
And here is your birthday present .,3
A gold watch !,6
Do you like it ?,3
"I love it ! Darling , you ' re kind .",3
What are the pop groups that you like ?,3
"Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool !",3
I agree ! I cried for a week when they broke up .,3
"I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds .",3
The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ' s driving me crazy .,4
Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .,3
"Yeah , I ' ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?",3
Is this Zhang Lin's home ?,3
"Yes . Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time . Well , come in and sit down . How about something to drink ?",3

"Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ' s very worried .",4
I ' m so sorry I ' m late . But Henry ' s car broke down .,4
I don ' t really like Henry . I like my Rose .,1
I don ' t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ' m going to marry him .,1
But my Rose is great .,4
Your Rose is a fool .,1
"Really , Mary , you ' re horrible .",0
"Why don ' t you marry Rose , then ?",0
Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night .,3
"Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' .",3
He seems to win awards everywhere .,3
He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World .,3
"I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . '",3
"That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia .",3
"This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move .",3
You do ?,4
"Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too .",3
No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together !,6
"Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck .",3
No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil !,6
"It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent .",3
Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .,3
"Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?",3
"Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ' t they ?",3
"Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ' m going to prune the hedge .",3
The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?,3
Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .,3
"When the lower branches are removed , you ' ll be able to sit under the tree .",3
"Tomorrow , I ' ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect .",3
Just make sure children don ' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .,3
When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ?,3
Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister .,4
Well ... How about Friday then ?,4
Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ?,3
"I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ?",3
That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you .,3
I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday !,3
I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here .,3
I trust you ' re keeping well ?,3
"I'm doing great , thank you .",3
So we can get down to business .,3
Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ...,3
They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ...,3
Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once !,3
But that way you're not savoring it .,4
Whatever . Give me another pack .,4
Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone !,6
"What a nice dress , Jean . You look marvelous !",3
"You , too . Where did you get your new hat ?",3
"From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ?",3
Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband !,3
"Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married .",3
"He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon !",3
"She's chic , isn't she ?",3
"Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed .",3
"It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say .",3
Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her .,3
Most women follow fashion like sheep . They don't know any better than imitate .,1
I quite agree with you . See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !,1
"The gown is quite expensive , believe me .",3
So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .,1
You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .,3
"You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .",3
Thanks . I'm flattered .,3
"Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while .",1
did you get my email ?,4
I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?,4
sure .,4
how did the business trip go ?,4
"well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .",1
"I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !",4
I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !,4
our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .,4
"I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me .",1
I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .,3
thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !,3
no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?,3
"no , should I have ?",4
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired .,4
My father failed in business .,5
"Oh , that's really tough .",4
Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .,5
"I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?",4
"No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties .",5
"Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .",4
"Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?",4
Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?,4
"Oh , it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?",4
"Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .",4
Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !,3
"Yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .",4
That ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?,4
Of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .,4
"You mean you got working experience , right ?",4
Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .,4
It must be very demanding .,4
"Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ' s easy to figure out .",4
Really ? It sounds interesting .,6
Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .,3
Great . I ' m looking forward to it .,3
"Good morning , Mary !",3
"Good morning , John !",3
I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?,3
"I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ?",3
"Yes , if that's all right for you .",3
"I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ?",3
"Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .",3
That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven .,3
It's snowing outside .,3
"Oh , how could it be ?",6
Let's go out and have a look .,3
OK . Wait a minute .,3
"Look at the snow , it's so beautiful .",3
Yes . It's really snowing .,3
"I love winter , I love snow .",3
But don't you think it's a little too cold ?,4
But I like cold more than hot .,4
You are so interesting .,3
Did you bring some lunch with you ?,4
"Yes , I packed it myself .",3
"Wow , that looks beautiful .",3
"It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty .",3
I might try it myself .,3
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?,3
Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?,3
"I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .",3
That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?,3
"I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .",3
"If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?",3
"I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .",3
You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .,3
"The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .",3
The Taj it is then .,3
Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?,3
They'll still charge us a corkage fee .,3
That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .,3
Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .,3
Are you sure ? We could go Dutch .,6
"No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time .",3
I won't argue with that ! Let's go !,3
Are you going to the party on Saturday ?,4
I was thinking about it . Are you ?,4
"Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun .",3
"Really ? Well , what time does it start ?",6
It starts at 8,4
"Well , who all is going to be there ?",4
Everyone from school .,4
How do you know it's going to be so fun ?,4
"This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks .",3
"Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun .",3
So am I going to see you at the party ?,3
"Yeah , I will be there .",3
"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?",4
"I ' m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !",3
What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?,4
"It ' s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ' m an Aries . When were you born ?",4
January 5th .,4
"Let ' s see . . . you ' re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ' ll both have interesting summers !",3
"That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .",4
"No , it ' s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .",4
"Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?",4
A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !,3
You ' re all set now ?,3
"Oh , thank you so much .",3
"Really , it was nothing .",3
I really appreciated it .,3
I was happy to help .,3
It was so kind of you .,3
Don ' t mention it .,3
You ' re a real friend in need .,3
"David , what have you been up to lately ?",4
I went on a trip with my family last week .,4
Really ? Where did you go ?,6
We went to Europe .,4
What cities did you go to ?,4
"London , Paris and a few other cities .",4
Did you go to Berlin ?,4
"No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time .",4
I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .,3
That's what I've heard .,3
"I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city .",3
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?,3
It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .,3
"Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?",3
Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...,3
Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .,3
You're dancing so well .,3
You dance beautifully too .,3
When did you learn to dance ?,3
In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?,3
It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .,3
How about tango ?,3
"Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?",3
Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ),3
Thank you for the dance .,3
What do you think ?,4
It looks great .,3
I would like to purchase it .,3
Will this be cash or charge ?,4
"Here , take my credit card .",4
"Just sign here , please .",4
Sure . Here you go .,3
Here's your receipt . Have a nice day .,3
"Now , you are to board the plane . We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China .",5
I appreciate what you have done for me . Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you .,3
We are ready to help you .,3
"Will you be kind to say "" Thank you "" to Mr . Zhang and other friends for me ?",3
I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us . Welcome to China again .,3
"Of course , I will . Well , it's time for me to say goodbye . The plane will take off soon . Hope some day you will come to America for a visit .",3
Thank you . I will if I have chance . Goodbye and happy landing !,3
Goodbye !,3
"What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .",3
I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble .,3
"No , I shouldn't think so . By the way , is there a socket for my razor ?",3
I think so . Here it is . It ' s by the basin .,4
Is it a two-pin socket ?,4
"Yes , it is .",4
"Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug .",3
It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck .,3
I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .,3
"Yes , goodbye and keep in touch .",3
"Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?",4
"Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ?",4
I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?,4
"Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .",3
"I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?",4
"A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .",4
You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .,6
"Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .",4
"Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?",3
"Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you .",4
"8 pm , that's fine with me .",4
So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .,4
"Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night .",4
"Ok , George . Bye !",4
"Bye , Ann !",4
I'd like to meet you again sometime .,3
"That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime .",3
Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 .,3
"Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week .",3
"It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon",3
"Bye , Jason .",3
I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg .,3
Are they coming to Chicago again ?,3
Yes . They ' re coming the beginning of August .,3
"Oh , good ! We can all get together again .",3
I ' m glad they ' re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game .,3
And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park .,3
Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ?,3
"Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs .",3
I had a great time . It ' ll be good to see them again .,3
"Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .",4
I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?,3
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .,5
I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?,5
"Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .",4
You need a babysitter .,4
"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .",4
I could have Suzy stay at my place .,4
"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",4
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,4
"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",4
"I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .",4
I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .,4
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .,3
I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .,4
Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .,3
"Hi , Sara , what are you reading ?",4
"Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter .",4
"Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard .",4
What for ?,4
"So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends .",4
That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ?,3
You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ?,6
"Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle .",3
"Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want .",6
"Please go ahead , I am listening .",3
I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .,4
Is your back door higher than the ground level ?,4
"Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground .",4
"Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail .",4
I don't like things to be fancy .,4
Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look .,3
"Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?",3
Cedar is a good choice .,3
"Well , let's take the measurements right now .",3
Oh that ' s a lovely necklace .,3
Thank you . My husband gave it to me .,3
Oh I didn ' t know you were married .,3
Yes I am . I got married five years ago .,3
Oh I see . That ' s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ?,4
"No , we met at university .",4
"Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ?",4
I didn't have any big plans .,4
We are putting together a birthday party for Mary .,3
That sounds like fun . Where will it be ?,3
We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house .,3
Oh good ! Can I bring anything ?,3
"We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes .",3
I am assuming that the dress is casual .,3
Dress casually and bring your bathing suit !,3
Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there .,3
"Craig , what do you do for work ?",4
I'm still a student .,4
What school do you go to ?,4
Boston University .,4
That's a good school . What do you study ?,4
"I'm studying English , math , and history . My major is English .",4
How long have you been studying English ?,4
More than six years .,4
That's a long time .,4
"Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school .",4
No wonder your English is so good .,3
"Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice .",3
I see . Talking with other people is very important .,3
"Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet .",3
I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come .,3
Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come .,3
"Hey , that ' s a very nice hairdo you ' re wearing !",3
Oh you ' re exaggerating . I ' m never really good at making hairdo .,3
"You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good !",6
"Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise .",3
He ' s just got no idea of how good you are .,3
Did you enjoy that new movie ?,4
"That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon .",4
"Oh , what happened , Carole ?",4
"I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it .",4
"What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .",6
"Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ?",4
Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ?,4
His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .,5
I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .,4
I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .,5
Doesn't sound promising .,4
"Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug .",5
If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .,4
"Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class .",3
What are you doing this weekend ?,4
I am not sure . What are you doing ?,4
I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach .,3
That sounds like a great idea !,3
Would you be interested in joining me ?,3
"Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ?",3
I thought that we could leave around 8,3
That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ?,3
That was part of my plan .,3
"Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you .",3
"How are you feeling , John ?",4
"Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed .",4
Do more exercises after you are healthy .,3
"Ok , I will . You have said that many times .",3
Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ?,3
"No , there ' s no need . Thank you all the same .",3
I want to try something different today .,3
I want a different hair style .,3
What style do you want ?,4
Can you make my hair short ?,3
Exactly how short do you want it ?,4
Make it a few inches long .,3
Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ?,4
I've been thinking about this for a while now .,3
Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want .,4
I honestly want my hair that short .,3
"All right , then let's begin .",4
"I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking .",0
It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ?,4
It ' s simply because the tins were damaged .,0
"It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way .",4
"I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling .",0
Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ?,4
"Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us .",4
Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably .,4
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !,0
Why ? What are they like ?,4
They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !,0
Have you ever talked to them about it ?,4
"I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !",0
What did they say ?,4
They both just talk about how great they are all the time .,0
They soud like the neighbours from hell !,0
"They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .",0
I thought you didn't talk to them much .,4
"I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .",4
What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?,4
Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .,4
Maybe you should think about moving .,4
I can't afford to move right now .,1
"Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .",4
"I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .",1
"Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ?",4
I don ' t think I can take another semester of this dorm food .,1
"I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired .",1
"Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself .",1
Have you found anything yet ?,4
You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?,4
"You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school .",4
"I got a car , so the distance wouldn ' t really be a problem .",4
But the parking might be .,4
You bet !,4
"Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day .",4
"I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ?",3
"Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop .",3
Right !,3
I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little .,3
Ok .,4
"Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful .",3
"Ahahah , and I thought you were tired .",3
You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses .,3
"It sure looks special , looks expensive too .",3
"Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ?",3
"Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered .",3
"Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in .",3
"Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park .",3
"It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it .",3
It is a great place for a relaxing vacation .,3
Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .,3
"Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good .",3
What are those ?,3
Do you mean the red things ? They are roses .,3
I'm going to take more pictures today .,3
"Me , too .",3
"This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up .",4
Are you serious ?,6
"Yes , I mean it .",4
But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?,6
"No , we are just too different . This isn ' t working .",4
"Hey , come on . It ' s too early to say that . We can fix things .",5
I have thought about it for a while . I think it ' s time to move on for both of us .,4
But I still love you .,5
I ' m sorry .,4
I knew this would happen some day ...,5
Then why didn ' t you talk to me ?,4
"Well . It ' s not all my fault , Anna ...",5
"I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ' s try and be friends .",4
"I would like that Anna , but I think I ' ll need a little space for a bit .",5
I think we ' ll be better off if we are apart .,4
Shall we keep pur friendship ?,5
"Sure , let ' s just be friends .",4
how's it going ?,4
"I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ?",4
"to be honest , I'm a bit fed up .",0
what's wrong ?,4
"well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .",0
that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it .,4
"the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't .",0
I see how that can get a bit annoying .,4
a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar .,0
so what are you going to do about it ?,4
"I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him .",4
what do you think would make you happier ?,4
"in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .",4
relationships can be confusing sometimes .,4
what would you do if you were me ?,4
I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him !,4
"Hi , how are you doing ?",4
I'm fine . How about yourself ?,3
I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking .,3
No problem . So how have you been ?,4
I've been great . What about you ?,3
I've been good . I'm in school right now .,3
I go to PCC .,4
Do you like it there ?,4
It's okay . It's a really big campus .,4
Good luck with school .,3
It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week .,3
Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind .,3
Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy .,3
Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky .,3
Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture .,3
Yes . Will it hurt us ?,3
I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .,3
OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .,3
"I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know .",3
"You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree .",3
"Well , it is a birch tree . It is not as old as you think .",3
How do you know ?,4
Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree .,3
Here ' s a letter for you .,4
Let me see it .,4
Who ' s the letter from ?,4
It ' s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance .,4
Read it !,4
UCLA accepted me !,3
I ' m not joking . I got accepted !,3
I ' m so happy for you !,3
"UCLA was my second choice , but I ' m happy knowing I ' Ve been accepted .",3
I am really proud of you .,3
You have no idea how proud I am of myself .,3
"Hi , it is a pleasant surprise !",3
"Yeah , it ' s been ages ! So how have you been ?",3
Couldn ' t be better . And you ?,3
"Just as usual , you know .",3
What's the bonus like at your company ?,4
"Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary .",4
Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible !,6
Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .,4
"Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt .",4
"Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases .",4
What did you buy ?,4
A new home health monitor .,4
"Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket . They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .",6
You're kidding !,6
No joke !,4
That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them .,4
Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ?,4
I'm going out this Saturday .,4
Do you already have a foursome ?,4
"Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work .",4
That sounds good . Where do you want to play ?,4
"We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work .",4
How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close .,4
How much does it cost over there ?,4
Twilight rates are 21 dollars .,4
That's pretty good . Let's do it .,3
Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4,4
Make it 4,4
Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time .,3
Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then .,3
Aright . Have fun on Saturday .,3
Will do .,3
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .,4
"Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .",3
What does it come with standard ?,4
"On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well . The Accord com",4
Cruise control ? I don't like that .,4
"Why not , sir ?",6
I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?,4
"Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .",4
I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .,4
"You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .",4
I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?,4
"No , the sunroof is optional , sir .",4
I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .,4
"Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .",4
"That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?",3
"We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .",4
My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .,4
"I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?",4
"Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?",4
"Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .",4
"Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .",3
"You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .",3
"Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .",4
"Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment .",4
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ?,3
I suppose I do .,3
The climate here is pleasant .,3
You said it .,3
This city is really comfortable to live in .,3
It sure is .,3
No other city can match it . It's heaven .,3
"Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much .",4
Maybe .,4
That's for sure .,4
Come and sit down . Would you like a drink ?,3
"Oh , yes please ! I'd love a gin and tonic .",3
Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ?,3
"Oh , just olives please . What music is this ?",3
Do you like it ? It's Irish music .,3
It's great ! Where did you get the CD ?,3
Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall . Have you been there ?,3
"Yes . I buy a lot of stuff from there . It's a good shop , isn't it ?",3
"Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ?",3
Why not ? I'd love to !,3
"Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?",4
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !,3
That ' s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .,4
What does that mean ?,4
"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ' s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ' s begin ! I need a volunteer .",4
"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .",4
"Wait , what are you doing ? I ' m a married woman ! You can ' t just try to kiss me like this !",6
Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .,4
"Well , OK . But no French kissing !",4
"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ' s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .",4
"Wait , what are you doing ! You can ' t just kiss me then go for second base !",6
Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown .,3
Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University .,3
"Yes , we are very proud of her .",3
"Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ?",3
"Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ?",3
"No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector .",3
I'd like to see that myself .,3
"Have a wallet size print made for me , too .",3
"Hi , Tony . Haven ' t seen you for a long time . How have you been ?",4
"OK , I ' Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ' t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ?",4
"Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant .",4
Are you well paid ?,4
"Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening",4
Not bad .,4
"Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ' ll surely get it .",3
That ' s great ! I ' ll go there right now and speak with the boss .,3
There ' s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ' Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job .,3
"That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot .",3
"Think nothing of it , Tony . I ' m sure you ' d do the same for me .",4
"Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know .",4
"First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . '",4
"Be a yes-man , you mean ?",4
You may put it that way if you like . Don ' t worry . You ' ll have no problem .,3
I hope not .,3
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ?,4
Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ?,4
I'm thinking about taking his class next semester .,4
He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ?,4
"I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades .",4
"Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ?",4
I really need to learn this stuff .,3
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?,4
"Yes , that sounds right for me .",3
Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ?,4
"Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing .",3
I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year !,3
I'm better now . Want to play again ?,3
I'll let you break the balls this time .,3
Let's get all the balls out of the pockets .,3
OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ?,3
You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles .,6
"Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ?",4
"Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ?",6
"Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box .",3
What's in it ?,4
Have a guess .,4
A necklace ?,4
No .,4
I have no idea .,4
Open it now .,4
"Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you !",6
"You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future .",3
"Beautiful day , isn't it ?",3
"Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all .",3
I wish it would stay this way for the weekend .,3
As long as it doesn't snow !,3
"Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ' s going ' on ?",4
"You can say that again . Susan ' brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ' s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit .",0
How gross ! I can ' t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ?,6
He doesn ' t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .,0
"Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ' ll never hit the road . After all , he ' s got it made in the shade here .",4
You think he might stay even longer ? !,6
"Now , don ' t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ' re getting the house fumigated !",4
That wouldn ' t be a lie !,0
Many congratulations on your winning the game .,3
"That ' s very kind of you , but it ' s nothing special .",3
You were doing great out there !,3
"Well , actually it ' s just about luck .",3
Do you have a bf ?,4
"Yes , I had a bf before .",4
Why you say bf before ?,4
We parted from each other last month .,4
Have you got a new one ?,4
"Mmmm , no . How about you ?",4
"I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you .",4
"Haha , so you are my E-bf .",3
I like you . Do you agree to be my of ?,3
"Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be .",3
Wow ! Blablablabla . . .,3
Hey ! What is it ?,3
I am flying like a bird .,3
LL,3
I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne .,3
I have no champagne right now . How about this ?,3
"It's OK , so I send you this .",3
Is it made of chocolate ?,3
It's my heart ; it's made of what you like .,3
"Oh , I will have a sweet dream .",3
Are you sleepy ?,3
A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to .,3
"Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office .",3
Thx . Bye for now . Kisssssssssss .,3
"C U here , honey .",3
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?,4
it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .,4
"well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?",4
of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...,4
don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .,4
you're dancing so well .,3
you dance beautifully too .,3
when did you learn to dance ?,4
in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?,4
it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz .,4
how about tango ?,4
"oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?",4
Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot .,4
thank you for the dance .,4
my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .,3
ok .,3
Why don ' t we go the cinema tonight ?,3
That sounds good but I don ' t know what ' s on .,3
I think there ' s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ' s go and see that .,3
"Ok , that ' s a good idea . Where shall we meet ?",3
Well how about meeting at my place ?,3
That sounds good . I ' ll call you once I arrive .,3
What's the time now ?,4
"Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch .",4
"You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ?",4
"In the coming , before going to work .",4
"You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it .",4
OK . I'll turn it on .,3
All right . It's just four o'clock .,3
"Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you .",3
I think it's high time we had lunch .,3
Of course . I can eat a horse now .,3
I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery .,3
Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ?,3
I suppose the local one .,3
Are you free this Saturday evening ?,4
"Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening .",4
Would you like to go to the concert with me ?,3
"I'd like to , where ?",3
At our club .,4
When ?,4
At 7:30 p . m .,4
"I'll go in time , thank you .",3
I'm so pleased that you can go .,3
Did you call me ?,4
Thank you for returning my call .,3
What was your call about ?,4
I wanted to have a talk with you about your son .,4
What did he do ?,4
He was messing around last week in class .,4
Exactly what did he do ?,6
"Even though I asked him not to , he kept speaking out in class .",4
I don't know what his problem is .,4
"I need you to talk to him , if you don't mind .",4
"That won't happen again , I'm sorry .",5
Thank you . Hopefully I won't have to call about him again .,3
I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .,2
Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm .,3
Congratulations . That's great !,3
I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .,3
When do you start ?,4
I start next Monday .,4
You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know .,3
"I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting .",3
I bet . You must be stoked .,3
Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ?,3
Sure . It's on you right ?,3
Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ?,4
I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now .,4
"I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help .",4
That sounds like a good idea .,3
"Hello , this is Helen speaking .",4
"Hello , Helen . This is John . How are you ?",4
"Fine , thanks . I ' ll have a party next Sunday at home . I ' m calling to ask whether you can come or not .",3
"Oh , how wonderful . I ' ll be glad to .",3
"Okay , now you are a famous star .",3
"Hum , don ' t say that . Maybe you can do something useful for me .",4
What ' s wrong with you ?,6
I ' ll tell you at the party .,4
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable .,4
It's us .,5
What do you mean by us ?,4
"Well , you always say you're busy .",5
That's right .,4
And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .,4
"I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me .",4
"Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it .",4
You mean I am groaned a few words ?,4
Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage .,5
She ' s going to live in Paris .,6
"Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ?",4
Nothing special .,4
How about having dinner with me ?,3
That's great . I would love to . And when ?,3
"Let ' s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ?",3
"No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner .",3
Don ' t worry . I will arrange everything .,3
"All right , see you tonight .",3
You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ?,3
"There are three of them , the Three Tenors .",3
"Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ?",3
"Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing .",3
I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song .,3
"Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert .",3
"Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio .",3
Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ?,3
"Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 .",3
"Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .",3
"That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever .",3
Who was the conductor at that event ?,3
"Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday .",3
So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future .,3
"The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational .",3
"I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet .",3
I just love your hair that way .,3
Where did you have it done ?,4
My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ?,4
Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it .,4
"Well , it looks very nice .",3
It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding .,3
How can I forget my old friend ?,3
My best wishes to you and the bride !,3
"Where to , miss ?",4
"Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner .",4
"Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ?",4
From China .,4
"Really ? You don ' t look very Chinese to me , if you don ' t mind me saying so .",6
"It ' s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products .",3
"Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?",3
Don ' t you know it ' s rude to ask a lady her age ?,4
Don ' t get me wrong ! It ' s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !,4
"Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?",3
"I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage .",4
Really ? That ' s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?,6
Uh ... yeah .. of course !,4
Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol !,3
I can ' t believe it !,6
What ' s wrong ? That was a great goal .,4
"Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !",6
Looks like you ' re going to lose out on this game then .,4
I can ' t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .,6
What were the odds ?,4
"20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !",6
Too bad .,4
"Jenny , are you having a good time ?",3
"Yes , of course . This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food .",3
I ' m glad you are enjoying yourself .,3
It ' s my pleasure . Can I get you another glass of champagne ?,3
"Yes , I ' d love another glass . You ' re a wonderful host . Thank you for everything .",3
It ' s my pleasure having you here .,3
"Hello , Mr . Green . This is Lin Tong . How are you ?",4
"Hi , Mr . Lin . I am leaving tomorrow and I am just packing .",4
"Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting .",5
"It doesn't matter , Mr . Lin . I can understand . I know you are always very busy . Work must come first .",4
Thanks a lot . You have been here for almost three weeks . How time flies !,4
Yes . And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing .,3
It is our pleasure . It has been a great pleasure to work with you .,3
Me too . I am looking forward to cooperating with you again .,4
"Really ? Great ! We will . Well , what's your flight number ? When are you leaving tomorrow ?",4
"It's Flight No . 104 , Northey Airlines , which leaves at ten O'dock tomorrow evening .",4
"OK , I will send someone to see you off .",4
That is so thoughtful of you .,3
My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip .,3
Thanks a lot . My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit .,3
Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye .,3
Goodbye . Thanks again .,3
"Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come .",3
"Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you !",3
"Thank you , shall I open it now ?",4
"Yes , please do .",4
"Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you .",3
"Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself .",3
"Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now .",3
"Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !",0
I can ' t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .,0
"20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !",0
Here ' s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?,4
"Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run .",4
What ' s the score ?,4
"Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ' s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base .",4
So Baltimore is winning ?,4
Right .,3
This is a really great place to watch a baseball game .,3
"Yeah , there isn ' t a bad seat in the place .",3
"The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia .",3
It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game .,3
"Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ' s favorite pastime .",3
What a pin-up she is !,3
Can you imagine she's over forty ?,3
That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure .,6
Absolutely . She ' s a teacher of aerobics .,3
I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ' s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well .,4
"I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her .",4
"Now , she ' ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states .",4
"Yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ' s cheaper .",4
"You ' re right . By the way , did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ?",4
Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago .,6
They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ' t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .,4
Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ' s he going to do with it ?,6
"He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ' s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ' t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires .",4
I had some good financial news yesterday too .,4
Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ?,6
"No , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ' Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way .",4
"It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ?",4
"Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do .",3
What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ?,3
Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final .,3
"Then , what shall we do on Sunday .",4
Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .,3
"Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .",3
What do you do when you are angry ?,4
I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger .,4
That ' s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?,3
Something like listening to music is a good idea .,3
"Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?",4
Classic . Something that could calm your mind .,3
I think that might work for me as well .,3
Working out is another good way to relieve anger .,4
Like what ?,4
"Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk .",4
"Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ?",4
"Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow .",5
Really !,6
How do you feel about that ?,4
"Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here .",5
"Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ?",4
"Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife .",4
What especially about the night life are you going to miss ?,4
"Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London .",4
How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ?,4
"Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee .",4
Can you believe the headlines ?,4
What are you reading ?,4
"I ' m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King .",4
"Didn ' t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ' t he ?",4
He got arrested all right .,4
"If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .",1
"Yup , that ' s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .",1
"I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ' s still a millionaire .",1
That ' s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .,1
I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .,4
You have a nice apartment .,3
"Hi , John , how was your vacation ?",4
"Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand .",3
"Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia .",3
Wow ! Isn ' t that dangerous ?,4
"A little , but the rush was worth it .",4
"Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating .",3
"Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ?",4
"Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me .",5
"Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ?",6
She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .,5
Do you believe her excuse ?,4
Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly .,5
"Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love .",4
"Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend .",3
"Mum , this is for you .",3
"Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ?",3
"Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum !",3
"Oh , thank you . You are so sweet !",3
Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in .,4
I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ' s the end of the year .,3
Perfect ! I like this one .,3
"That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .",4
Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?,3
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .,4
That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ' s under the hood ?,3
"A very powerful 2 . 5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !",3
Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?,4
Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .,4
Great ! Let ' s do it !,3
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ?,4
Okay ! What do you suggest ?,4
How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater .,3
Is that so ? Why not ?,3
"( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead .",6
What's on ?,4
Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night .,4
That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ?,4
"Ah . The Royal , I think .",4
What time does it start ?,4
"Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think .",4
But we won't have enough time for dinner .,4
Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ?,4
Ah ... I fancy going to the later show .,4
"Then , there's a 9:30 show .",4
"That's Okay , I think .",3
Could you show me the coat on the shelf ?,4
Sure . Please come this way .,3
May I try it on ?,4
Of course . Here is the fitting room .,3
It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ?,4
"Yes , here it is .",4
"Well , how do I look in this one ?",4
You look really beautiful in it .,3
OK . I'll take it .,3
What are you doing this Saturday ?,4
Not much .,4
Do you want to go see a movie ?,3
That sounds good .,3
What's playing at the Century Fox ?,4
Candlelight in the Window,4
Should we go see it ?,3
I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies .,4
How about ' Run of the Mill ? ',3
No . I heard that's really boring .,4
Why don't we go to a concert instead ?,3
Great idea !,3
"Hi , Mike , what gives ?",3
"Hi , Bill , this is my new car .",3
"Hey , great set of wheels .",3
"You like it , huh ?",3
"Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world .",3
"It is special , isn't it ?",3
"Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?",3
Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years .,3
I can imagine .,3
"Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out .",3
"Ok , let's go .",3
I'm happy to see you again .,3
"Okay , I'll give you a ring next week .",3
"And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time .",4
"Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today .",6
"Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job .",3
"No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement .",4
"Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides . She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint .",4
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions .,3
"Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points .",3
"Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job .",3
"Nice day today , isn't it ?",3
"Yes , beautiful weather we're having .",3
We can't complain about the weather recently .,3
"Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold .",3
I wonder how long this weather can last .,3
I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family .,3
Does 6 thirty suit you ?,3
"Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary .",4
I am very pleased to meet you .,3
Bob is in advertising .,3
"That sounds an interesting job , Bob .",3
"Oh , my God ! What's this ?",4
Look ! This window is open .,4
Did you open it before we left ?,4
Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ?,6
I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ?,4
"No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house .",6
It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in .,4
I locked it when I left though .,4
"Yes , but the robber broke in . Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked .",4
"I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question !",0
Look around .,4
The TV's still here .,4
And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs .,4
But what if someone's still up there ?,4
"I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ?",4
"I couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful !",3
You are pretending !,3
"No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ?",3
It's wrong because---it isn't true .,3
"You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ?",3
"Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again .",1
"Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long .",5
Hello Mary . I haven ' t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ?,4
No . We broke up last month . I ' m taking a break from dating for a while .,4
Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up .,4
We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ?,4
"Yes , I am . We ' re thinking about getting engaged . We ' Ve been dating for over a year now .",3
Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ?,3
"I havn't seen her for a while . She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her . He was seeing a girl form his office . One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .",4
She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon .,4
Really ? They ' Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ?,6
I think it ' s 26th September . I ' ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night .,4
"Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you .",3
"He certainly looks interested , doesn ' t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ?",3
"Hello , Jill .",4
"Tom , You're back , come in please . How are you ?",4
"Fine , only a little tired .",4
You'll recover after a good night's sleep .,4
Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence .,3
That's all right . Would you have a cup of coffee ?,3
"Yes , Please . It ' s very kind of you .",3
The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well . You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me .,3
It's my pleasure .,3
"I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them .",3
Thank you . Thank you for the trouble you've taken .,3
Did your wife give birth yet ?,4
Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl .,3
Congratulations . How is your wife doing ?,3
"She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now .",3
That's good to hear .,3
I'm just glad there were no complications .,4
"If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ?",4
"It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well .",4
That's normal for anyone with a newborn .,4
"Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate .",4
"You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health .",4
That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time .,4
Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad .,4
I just lost my job . My boss just told me .,5
That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ?,6
I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money .,5
I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years .,6
My goodness . She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race .,6
Excuse me . What did you say ?,4
A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games,4
That's incredible . I cann't believe it .,6
You have to . It's sure .,4
"Joe , how are you doing ?",3
"Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ?",3
"I am free that night , and a party sounds good .",3
Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ?,3
"I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ?",3
I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ?,3
"I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK .",3
"Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine .",3
Would you like some help with the food ?,3
Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink .,3
Good game ?,4
Not bad . But too hot for me today .,4
"Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ?",4
Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?,4
"Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners .",4
"Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ?",6
16 . Yours ?,4
"No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob .",3
Jane . Nice to meet you .,3
"Me too . So , do you like the course ?",3
"Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?",4
"Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .",4
"Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .",3
"Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .",4
"Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?",4
"Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !",4
"How awful , poor guy .",4
"Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him .",4
"Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ?",6
Yup .,4
"Happy Anniversary , honey .",3
I thought you had forgotten .,3
"After the trouble I got into last year , no way .",3
"Thank you honey , it means a lot to me .",3
"Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University !",3
How about you ? Have you got any news from university ?,4
I am glad you can study something you really like !,3
"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator .",3
"Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ' t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works .",3
I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice .,3
"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ' s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .",3
Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .,4
"Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .",4
Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie .,3
He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie .,3
"He ' s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day .",3
"A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match !",3
The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie .,4
"Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important .",4
"My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat .",4
"My father wears a tie every day , but he can ' t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning .",4
You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife .,4
Thanks for coming shopping with me .,3
I'm so honored that you thought to ask me .,3
I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before .,3
You're going to do great . And you're going to look great .,3
Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion .,3
I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you .,3
"The question is , can he have it done before Friday ?",4
These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask .,4
Do you like flowers ?,3
"Of course , I like .",3
What's your favorite flower ?,3
Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival .,3
Spring is a lively season .,3
Yes . How about you ?,3
I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .,3
You have a perfect taste !,3
It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms .,3
But it used to be ignored by many people .,4
The bright people will remember it forever .,4
"Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing .",4
Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ?,4
I'm at home painting .,4
I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ?,4
I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college .,3
That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby .,3
Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it .,3
I think I will . Thanks for the info .,3
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy .,4
"I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .",1
How come you think of him that way ?,4
Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .,1
I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .,4
Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ?,0
Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy .,4
All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead .,6
What a wonderful sight !,3
Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax .,3
We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place .,4
I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible .,4
"So would I . Look , it might be going to rain .",4
I don't think it will spoil our trip .,4
It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains .,3
Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads .,3
That's a good idea !,3
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ?,4
"Yes , we're making plans for a tour .",4
That'll be lovely . Where are you going ?,4
"Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday .",4
"Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then .",4
"Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ?",3
"It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too .",3
"Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street .",3
"So , you're going to have a really nice vacation .",3
You can say that again .,3
I have some good news for you .,3
What's that ?,3
Jenny is getting married .,3
Great ! Who's the bridegroom ?,3
"Tom , that lucky guy .",3
The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ?,3
"Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs . Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her .",3
My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ?,3
"July 4 , the National Holiday .",3
Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ?,3
Jenny plans to hold it in church .,3
Who is the best man ?,3
Guess !,3
"Nobody is OK , but you !",3
"You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man .",3
Did you promise him ?,3
"Yes , I did .",3
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise .,3
OK . It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .,3
"Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me !",3
Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left .,3
"Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu .",3
A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China .,3
That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook .,3
I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ?,3
I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ?,4
I made strawberry shortcake .,4
"Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice .",3
Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ?,3
I'll have a cup of tea .,4
Do you take cream or sugar with your tea ?,4
"Actually , could I have some milk with that ?",4
Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ?,4
"Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go .",5
I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up .,4
I'll go with you . Where is she ?,4
"She's on the M40 , near Reading .",4
Is she alright ?,4
"I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this .",5
"Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go .",4
"Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own .",4
Ok . Just call me if you need anything then .,4
I will . Thanks a lot .,3
"Guess , what I ' Ve bought for you .",4
Oh . it ' s a case flowers . It ' s very kind of you .,3
I hope you like it .,3
I love flowers you know . Thank you very much .,3
that ' s all right .,3
"Welcome , Li Mei . Please give me your coat and hat .",3
"Thank you , Peter .",3
"Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself .",3
"Happy birthday , Peter , and many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you .",3
"Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon .",3
What wish do you make ?,4
It's a secret .,4
"Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ?",4
"You don ' t love me , Roy .",0
Why do you say such words ? I love you very much .,4
"No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ' m dumb and uninteresting .",0
"Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ' s .",4
I envy her and also I hate her at the same time .,0
"Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply .",4
"Oh , shut up , Roy .",0
"But honey , I think you ' re terrific . There is nothing ...",4
"Oh , SHUT UP !",0
"Julia , are you free tonight ?",4
I want to invite you to go to the movies .,4
Are you asking me for a date ?,4
I don ' t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there .,4
Where do you want to meet ?,3
Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there .,3
What time should we meet ?,3
How about seven ?,3
"Mary , how was your date with John ?",4
It ' s OK . It seems we have a lot in common .,3
"Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?",6
"He is tall and slim , fair-haired .",3
Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?,3
He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous .,3
"Oh , it ' s love at first sight .",3
"Hello , Mary . What ' s the matter with you ? You look upset .",4
"My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ' m very sad . Because I don ' t want to lose this friend .",5
"Oh , I ' m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ' t be sad .",5
"Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ' m very sorry .",5
OK . Don ' t let it get to you . Goodbye .,4
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !,0
"I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .",4
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !,0
I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ?,4
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .,4
"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",4
I don't know .,4
"I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .",4
"We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",4
I have plenty of gas .,4
"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",4
So what can we do ?,4
"Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",4
Alright . That's a good idea .,3
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .,4
Days ?,6
"Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .",4
"Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .",3
Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .,4
"Okay , I'll follow your advice .",4
How about this floor lamp ?,4
"Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ' m so tired !",0
We still need to find an armoire and a dresser .,4
"Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things .",3
Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ' ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .,3
While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV .,4
Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ' t think so !,6
I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic .,3
Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs .,6
"Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard .",3
I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers .,3
"The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ?",3
Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now .,3
Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ?,3
Why not ?,3
Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ?,3
"Ok , you name the day .",3
How about the second of March ?,3
What day is that ?,3
It's Friday .,3
Good . Where shall we meet ?,3
I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow .,3
I know . It's going to be so much fun .,3
I always get excited the day before .,3
I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore .,3
"I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me .",3
That makes sense .,3
What things make you excited ?,3
"Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited .",3
Oh ... that makes me excited too !,3
Looks like anything fun makes you excited .,3
I've had enough of that !,1
"Why , this is the most interesting film !",6
I hate the hero . He ' s too cruel .,1
But it's only a film .,4
You look so tan and healthy !,3
Thanks . I just got back from summer camp .,3
How was it ?,4
Great . I got to try so many things for the first time .,3
"I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding .",4
I ' m so jealous .,4
The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes !,3
I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals .,3
A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people .,3
That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now .,3
Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people .,6
"why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy .",3
Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty .,3
"They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors .",3
I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything .,3
Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people .,3
"To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not .",3
You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .,3
"That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home .",3
You really can't live without candy .,3
Good morning Mike !,4
Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry !,4
"I am having an exam at nine , It's already eight thirty .",4
"Don't worry , I'll drive you .",3
Thank you very much !,3
How are your cases coming along ?,3
"Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it .",3
"Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ?",3
"Yes , It's only eight forty . Thanks so much !",3
"You're welcome . Good luck , bye !",3
"Have a nice day , bye !",3
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .,4
What part hurts ?,4
The shoulder .,4
"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .",4
It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .,2
C'mon . Just don't move .,4
I'm bleeding too much .,2
"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",4
"Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !",2
"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",4
"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",4
Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,4
"No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",2
"Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?",4
"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !",4
We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .,4
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .,4
"Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?",4
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .,4
"Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .",4
There . Stop !,4
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?,1
Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .,4
It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .,1
You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .,0
"Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !",0
It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .,4
"Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ' d rather I had an office of my own .",4
"Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ?",4
"Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ?",3
"Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work .",4
"I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ?",4
Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good .,4
Which one is that ?,4
"You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door .",4
"Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good .",3
Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ?,3
What time ?,3
At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation .,3
That's good . See you on Friday .,3
"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?",4
"Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !",3
Why are they all in glass boxes ?,4
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .,4
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?,4
"No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box .",4
I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?,4
"Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .",3
"Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV .",3
"It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !",6
"Good evening , I'm so happy you could come .",3
Thank you for inviting me .,3
"A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you .",3
"Rachel , do you like music ?",3
"Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go .",3
What kind of music do you like best ?,3
Light music and classic music .,3
Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ?,6
But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday .,4
I got two . We can go there together .,3
Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears .,3
Hi .,4
"Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ...",4
Yeah ?,4
You were playing it very late last night .,4
It kept me awake .,4
"Oh , I'm sorry .",5
It kept me awake a couple of hours .,4
"I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud .",5
"It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me .",4
It's true . It was a bit loud .,4
I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future .,4
"Oh , it's no problem . It ' s OK . You know , it only happened once .",3
I am glad we've straightened everything out .,3
"Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate !",3
It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card .,3
"You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody !",3
"Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ?",4
"If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing .",3
Then I bet he's really good !,3
"Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room !",3
"Frank ' s getting married , do you believe this ?",4
Is he really ?,6
"Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .",4
Who is he marring ?,4
"A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .",4
Have they set a date for the wedding ?,4
Not yet .,4
"Oh , God . It ' s late . I ' m afraid I have to leave .",2
But you just got here . Can ' t you stay a little longer and have some tea ?,4
That ' s very kind of you . But if I don ' t go now I ' ll miss the last bus .,4
That ' s too bad .,4
Thank you for your hospitality .,3
Thanks for coming .,3
"How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ' ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise .",4
Great idea . I ' m looking forward to it . See you then .,3
Well . I really do have to go .,4
Good night then .,4
See you tomorrow .,4
Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall .,4
"Yeah , I've been there twice .",4
Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ?,6
"Oh , it's fantastic .",3
Where did you go ?,4
"On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto .",3
What did you think of Tokyo ?,4
"Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too .",3
Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds !,3
And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive .,4
And how about Kyoto ?,4
Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens . It ' s a very historic city .,4
How was the weather ?,4
"I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October . It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity .",4
Sounds perfect . I can't wait !,3
"OK ... well , then how much is one jin ?",4
"Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin .",4
"30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ?",6
You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT .,4
Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs .,3
I'll have my brother cut some for you .,4
This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ?,4
"That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon !",3
"Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ?",4
"Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life !",3
And how about these little brown chips ?,4
"Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ?",4
"Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days .",3
"Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you .",3
I hope it will be of some use to you .,3
I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far .,3
That will be great .,3
"When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth .",6
"You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted .",6
I could not and can ' t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls .,6
"But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her .",4
"Look , there are some words on the fish .",4
I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays .,4
For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ?,0
Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic .,4
You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .,0
"Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal .",4
"Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ?",0
"OK , I understand , but what else could we do ?",4
Thank you for your letter .,3
Is your waist any better ?,4
"Yes , I ' m feeling very well these days .",3
I ' m glad you are getting better .,3
And I was glad to receive your letter .,3
Then when will you be back again ?,4
I will be back again next Wednesday .,4
I hope to see you at that time again . Bye .,4
Bye .,4
"What's Ron Marston like , Pauline ?",4
"He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone .",1
What did your boss say to him ?,4
"He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! "" Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ' t answer the phone !",1
Did he telephone again last night ?,4
"Yes , he did . He telephoned at nine o'clock .",4
What did you say to him ?,4
"I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ' t telephone my daughter again !",1
Did he telephone again ?,4
"No , he didn't !",4
Do you want to try your hand at tennis ?,3
Certainly I do .,3
It seems you're very fond of it .,3
I'd be happy to do something new .,3
Hi Mark .,4
What are you planning to do today ?,4
I'm not sure yet .,4
Would you like to have lunch with me ?,3
Yes . When ?,3
Is 11:30 AM OK ?,4
"Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ?",4
"I said , 11:30 AM .",4
"Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ?",4
"OK , how about 12:30 PM ?",3
OK . Where ?,3
How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ?,3
"Oh , Where is that ?",3
It's on 7th Street .,3
"OK , I'll meet you there .",3
Bill and Betty have already grown up .,3
"Yeah , oh my god ! It ' s still there . We have our first date right on there .",3
Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ?,3
You seemed to be dull at that time .,3
( Smile ) I can ' t believe this for it ' s been 20 years since we got married .,3
So do you feel happy now ?,3
I couldn ' t have been any happier !,3
"Of course , we are the happiest family in the world .",3
"I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details !",3
"Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing !",3
"Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ' s he like ?",4
"He ' s really good looking , he ' s quite tall , around 6 ' 1 "" , he ' s in his early thirties , and he ' s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...",3
He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ?,3
"You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ' s got a great career path ahead of him !",3
"Hold on a sec , his name is David ?",4
That ' s my brother !,4
Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?,3
I'll always remember my college days .,3
Oh yeah ?,4
"It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate .",3
How did you feel when you graduated ?,4
"It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end .",3
What did you do after graduation ?,4
"I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind .",3
Sounds like you're happy with your decision .,3
I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ?,3
"It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day .",4
How could it be ?,4
"While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do .",4
You didn't have an offer ?,4
"I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough .",4
"I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead !",4
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .,3
"Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .",3
Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .,3
While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries .,3
That is a really interesting fact .,3
I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach .,3
Just do whatever you feel like doing .,3
( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .,3
Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .,3
I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand .,3
I ' m just looking at this map of the world . I ' m preparing for a geography class .,4
There are no countries marked on the map .,6
"No , there aren ' t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .",4
"The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .",6
I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .,6
Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you .,4
The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .,4
It ' s all so interesting . I ' ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class .,3
Are you excited about your trip next month ?,4
"Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified .",4
"Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying .",2
"Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia .",6
You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia .,6
"I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad .",4
"Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak .",6
"Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds .",4
We are such weirdos right ?,4
Do you have any idea what time it is ?,0
My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late .,5
Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ?,4
Of course not . I really did lose track of time .,4
Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late ?,4
"Yeah , you did . I just forgot to call .",4
"It doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know .",4
That's true . My bad for not calling .,5
"If you do this again , don't even bother coming home .",0
You're going to kick me out over this ?,6
"Exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules .",4
"Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules .",0
Excuse me .,4
"Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ?",4
"I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet .",4
"I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes .",5
"Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long .",5
It doesn't matter .,3
They must have got in through the kitchen window .,4
If only we'd remember to close it .,4
"I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling !",6
I wish I'd put it in the bank .,4
Look ! they've taken your fur coat too .,6
"I know , I am sorry I ever bought it .",5
I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television .,4
It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company .,4
"I wish we could , but we can't , you see , we are not insured .",4
"Hello , Ellen .",4
"Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ' s been a horrible accident .",4
"Oh , no ! What happened ?",5
"Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work .",4
How awful ! Was he hurt ?,5
Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance .,4
How did it happen ?,4
His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house .,4
How horrible !,5
He ' s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is .,4
I hope he ' ll be all right .,4
"I hope so , too .",4
May I help you ?,4
"Yes , I would like to return these slacks .",4
Alright . Do you have your receipt ?,4
Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week .,4
And why are you returning them ?,4
I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match .,4
"I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale .",5
"Yes , they were thirty percent off .",4
"I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items .",5
I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before .,4
"I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy .",5
I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here . Can you make an exception this time ?,4
"Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment . Madam , the manager says can do it this time .",4
Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me .,3
Please show me your receipt again .,4
Here it is .,4
"I will have to give you store credit , Madam . If you can find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit .",4
Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot .,4
"We appreciate your business , Madam .",3
Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .,3
"Yes , it is . Thanks . I ' m just surfing on the internet .",3
Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?,6
"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !",4
That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?,3
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .,4
"So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?",4
I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .,4
"I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime !",4
"It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ?",3
Did you get your grades yet ?,4
Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now .,5
Why ? What happened ?,6
"Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1 . 7 .",5
Ouch . You must be very disappointed .,4
"Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have .",4
Why don't you re-take the class next year ?,4
That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ?,4
I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3 . 2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3 . 45 .,4
My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3 . 1 now because of the stupid econ class .,4
What was your GPA before this semester ?,4
I was sitting happy with a 3 . 4 .,4
Why did it go down so much ?,4
Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class .,4
What happened to you ?,4
I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time .,4
You better stop slacking off .,4
You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore .,4
What are your weekend arrangements ?,4
There're many things I can do on weekends .,4
What sort of things are you interested in ?,4
"I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ?",3
"I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours .",3
That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ?,3
"Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ?",4
I'm fond of dancing .,3
Good . You really know how to enjoy yourself .,3
What was the last movie you saw ?,4
"A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun .",4
"Really ? I've seen that movie , too .",6
How did you like the movie ?,4
I thought it was pretty good .,3
Really ? I can't say I agree .,6
You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding .,6
"I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed .",4
I guess it could happen .,4
What's your favorite book ?,4
It's Gone With the Wind .,4
Why do you like it best ?,4
I enjoy the various characters and the plot .,3
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .,3
Is it very interesting ?,4
"Sure . I like the writer's language , too .",3
"If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .",3
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?,3
That's a good idea . Let ' s go !,3
"How are you , Sue ?",3
Pretty good . I ' Ve just had my new poems published .,3
Congratulations on your success .,3
And how ' s your brother ?,3
He is fine .,3
"He ' s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?",3
Yes . He ' s already got the passport and visa .,3
Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations .,3
Thank you . He ' s very lucky indeed .,3
"Beautiful weather , isn ' t it ?",3
"Yes , it is . Are you here on business ?",3
"No , I ' m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges .",3
"I ' m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ?",3
"Yes , it is .",3
Why don ' t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ' ll have a better time .,3
I couldn ' t agree more .,3
"Great , let ' s go !",3
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .,4
"That ' s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market .",4
What kind of house is it ?,4
It ' s a wonderful Spanish style .,3
"Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses .",3
And it ' s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price .,3
"Great , is it a two bedroom house ?",3
"No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ' s a two-car garage .",4
That ' s a nice area too . It ' ll be a good investment for you .,3
"Yeas , when will you buy a house ?",4
"Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .",4
"Right , congratulations .",3
Taxi .,4
"Get on , PLS . Where do you wanna go ?",4
"Thank you . Pls hurry , I am late . Can I get to the Battery Park before 4 ?",3
"All right , Miss . I think we will get there if there are no delays on the way .",4
How exactly do you figure out the car fare ?,4
"According to the kilometer rate , the first five kilometers are 4 dollars and every kilometer extra costs 50 cents .",4
"Oh , I see .",4
"Here we are , Miss .",4
Thank you . How much do I owe you ?,3
You owe me 19 dollars .,4
That's 20 dollars . Keep the change !,3
"No problem , anytime .",3
Let me know if I can do anything for you .,3
"Okay , thank you .",3
Who's that man over there talking to James ?,4
"Where ? Oh , that's Henry .",4
"He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ?",3
"He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric .",4
Really ? I love eccentric people .,6
"Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you .",4
Why ? What do you mean by that ?,6
"Well , haven't you heard ?",4
Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything .,4
"Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary .",4
Really ! How fascinating .,6
"According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew .",4
"Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either .",4
"Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back .",4
Do you like climbing ?,3
"Yes , I like it very much .",3
How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ?,3
Where is it ?,3
"It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' .",3
Have you visited it before ?,3
"Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting .",3
Like what ?,3
"It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between .",3
Sounds marvelous .,3
You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .,3
Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing .,3
Steve . Is that you ?,6
Yeah . What's going on ?,4
Not much . What a surprise to see you here .,6
Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you .,4
I just started working out .,4
Really ? Where do you work out at ?,6
I joined the Samsung Health Club last month .,4
What do you mostly do during your workout ?,4
"I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach .",4
I should start exercising more .,4
"It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done .",4
"I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it .",4
Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising .,4
"If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym .",4
I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ?,3
That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend .,3
Great . I'll call you Saturday morning .,3
Aright . I'll talk to you later .,3
Ok . Bye .,3
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !,3
I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .,4
"Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch . But really , I think it's worth it .",4
"I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .",4
"How do you mean "" suffer "" ?",4
"I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food . So we miss the food in Taiwan too much . Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .",4
Even in the winter ?,4
"Yes , even in the winter .",4
"And even if it takes two hours , huh ?",4
Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !,3
"Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .",4
Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !,3
"I know . I can see that . This is what is called "" dim sum , "" right ?",4
"Yes , all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes . You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .",4
"So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?",4
Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .,3
"And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .",4
No way !,4
"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .",4
"Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?",4
"No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown .",4
Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?,4
"No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .",4
I wonder if you can cook things this good .,3
I'm a great cook actually . You will see .,3
"Well , how was your honeymoon ?",4
"It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing .",3
Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though !,3
"Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ?",3
My friends and I just got back from Bali .,3
"Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ?",3
"Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free .",3
Did you go diving while you were there ?,4
"I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead !",4
Did you take any pictures in the ocean ?,4
I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you .,3
Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?,3
We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ?,3
"No , but I do like snowboarding .",3
Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?,3
I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !,3
It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount .,3
What's up ? You look low .,4
It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game .,5
I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again .,5
I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart .,4
Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves .,5
"Hey , Daniel , how's it going ?",4
"Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .",3
"Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?",6
We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .,4
Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?,4
"Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .",4
"Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?",4
"Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty .",4
"Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?",4
"Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do .",4
"You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .",4
"OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .",3
"That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?",3
"Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?",3
"Exactly , now , tell me the time .",3
"I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you .",4
"Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company .",3
"Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it .",3
"You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?",3
"Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions .",3
"Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something .",3
"Come on , don ' t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ' t get this turned around without the support from you people .",3
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from !,3
"Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ?",3
I love fruit flavored ices the best .,3
"I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever .",3
What is your least favorite ice cream ?,4
I don't like peppermint ice cream .,4
"Yeah , I know what you mean .",4
"One time , I tried garlic ice cream .",4
That could be interesting .,4
That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order !,4
How do you feel about this restaurant ?,4
I really liked it !,3
I really enjoyed the food .,3
What did you enjoy the most ?,4
I enjoyed the fish the most .,4
"The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert .",3
The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world !,3
I really felt that the service was exceptionally good .,3
"Yes , the service really added to the experience .",3
I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant .,3
Does it look like a good fit ?,4
It's definitely your size .,3
"Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it .",3
How do you prefer to pay ?,4
Let me use my credit card .,4
"Now , if you'll just sign here .",4
I hope you enjoy your purchase . Good-bye .,3
Perfect . Couldn ' t be better !,3
"Come on , you must tell me everything about him .",4
"Well , he's very tall and handsome .",3
Hmm ...,4
He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair .,3
"Oh , how long ?",4
"Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold .",3
OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does .,4
He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well .,3
"He's quite a patient teacher , too .",3
Fine .,4
You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy .,3
I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 .,5
Don't worry about that .,4
Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble .,5
No trouble at all .,4
Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ?,4
"No , that's quite out of the question .",4
Please accept my deep apology .,5
I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it .,4
"Good afternoon , Sam .",3
"Good afternoon , Tina .",3
What are you going to do tomorrow ?,4
I'm not sure yet . And you ?,4
I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ?,4
Is skating interesting ?,4
"I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable .",4
But I can't skate well .,4
"It doesn't matter , I can teach you .",3
It's very kind of you .,3
I really appreciate your driving me around .,3
"It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .",3
It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .,4
So what do you see in there ?,4
This one sounds good . Efficiency with view of the lake . Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .,4
Can you afford that much ?,4
"No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .",4
"Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment . Usually one large room and a small bathroom . There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .",4
How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?,4
That means the apartment has furniture in it .,4
That's good .,3
"Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .",4
Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .,4
It's still pretty expensive .,4
"Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .",4
Alright . What's the phone number ?,4
256-7797 .,4
Got it . What else do you see ?,4
This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate . Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment . Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?,4
"No . It probably means they have a large apartment . Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms . They need someone for the empty bedroom .",4
That sounds alright .,3
"Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all . If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .",4
"Here's the number , 256-4367 .",4
Got it . Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .,4
Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .,3
"Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ?",3
"Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ?",4
I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ?,4
Would you like to play tennis with me ?,3
I'd like to .,3
Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning .,3
"OK , will do !",3
What a nice day !,3
Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?,3
"Great , let's go !",4
"Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .",3
"Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...",3
"Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !",4
"Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .",3
Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ?,4
"Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?",4
"Yeah , I think so .",4
Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .,3
Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .,3
I ' m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ?,3
Sure . Let ' s go . What are you going to have done ?,3
I want to have a foot massage and haircut .,3
A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ' d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ' s supposed to help with your complexion .,3
Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures .,3
This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour !,3
I think it ' s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ' t you agree ?,3
"Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .",4
Maybe we should try a thai massage too .,4
What ' s special about a thai massage ?,4
That ' s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet .,4
Sounds painful !,4
Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly .,3
Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice !,3
Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ?,3
"Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song .",3
How about this one ?,4
"Sorry , I can't sing the song .",4
Er ... How about this one ?,4
OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part .,4
Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part .,4
Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ?,4
My grandmother just passed away .,5
I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ?,4
A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral .,5
Is there anything I can do ?,4
No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time .,5
I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ?,4
Yeah . She died in her sleep .,4
I'm sorry she's gone .,4
At least she didn't suffer .,4
I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .,4
I know . But I miss her .,4
"When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said .",4
Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks .,3
It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat .,4
You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go .,3
"Of course , I like flowers .",3
"I like peach blossom , because I like spring .",3
Peach blossom is really beautiful .,3
I like lotus .,3
But there aren't any lotus now .,3
Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms .,3
That's not bad . Let's go .,3
"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .",3
Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?,6
"Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .",3
Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !,3
What other activities will you have tomorrow ?,4
"Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .",4
Do you bring some gifts along ?,4
"That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand .",4
Is it the same practice for all families ?,4
"Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .",4
I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .,4
"Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days .",4
What a hot day !,4
"Yes , summer is coming .",4
Where are you going this summer vacation ?,4
I'd like to go to Tianjin .,4
Do you want to go to the beach there ?,3
"Yes , of course . And what's your plan ?",3
The same to you .,3
Do you take a bus to and from work ?,4
"Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .",4
"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .",4
"Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .",1
"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .",1
What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?,4
"You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !",0
"Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?",4
"Yeah , absolutely !",4
"And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .",4
"You were so happy , weren ' t you ?",4
What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .,4
Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China .,3
"Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .",3
That must be very beautiful .,3
"Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies .",3
Really ? Have you ever been there ?,3
A couple of times .,3
Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me .,3
Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide .,3
Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .,3
"Tomorrow , I ' ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect .",3
Just make sure children don ' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .,4
There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month .,3
What kind of food will they be serving ?,4
"My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo .",3
It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .,3
I can hardly wait !,3
Do you know the day they plan to open ?,4
I'll double check the announcement .,4
Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ?,4
"You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ?",3
"Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts .",3
"Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .",3
Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart .,3
"Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ?",3
"Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future .",3
What does he look like ? Can people tell ?,3
"Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though .",3
"Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces .",4
"How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose . This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw .",4
Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool .,3
They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?,3
"That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different .",4
Janet Jackson is more pop music . Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes .,4
Have you heard Maria Carey ?,4
"Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like .",3
Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one .,3
I hope you have a good stereo .,4
Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .,4
The time has come to say goodbye .,5
So soon . It seems as if you just got here .,5
"I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say .",5
It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .,3
I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .,3
"It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine .",3
"You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ?",3
"Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring .",3
I'll be expecting you then .,3
You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ?,3
"In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go .",3
"Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone .",4
"You are not going to give it up , are you ?",4
"No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either .",4
I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .,4
"Yes , but whom to ?",4
"Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .",3
"That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees .",3
"Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then .",3
"Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy .",3
"Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .",3
"Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ' m allowed to repair cars for a living .",3
That ' s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .,3
I guess I never thought of that before .,3
"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .",3
"Wow , you ' Ve inspired me to do something !",3
"Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .",4
"Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .",3
I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .,4
"Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .",4
Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?,4
"Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?",4
History .,4
"Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your",4
Thirty percent ?,4
Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?,3
Yes . It's an excellent system .,3
"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?",4
"Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .",4
I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .,4
"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .",5
What ? Are you serious ?,6
But nobody uses Macintosh !,6
"That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma",4
"Yes , I'm from Taiwan .",4
"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .",4
But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .,4
There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .,4
Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .,5
"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .",4
"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .",3
"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .",3
"Excuse me , what's your name ?",4
My name is Jessica . What's yours ?,4
John .,4
You speak English very well .,3
Do you know what time it is ?,4
Sure . It's 5:10 PM .,4
What did you say ?,4
I said it's 5:10 PM .,4
Congratulations on the new house !,3
Thanks ! We love it .,3
"Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful .",3
I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !,4
It's taking you forever to do my hair .,0
Give me a minute .,4
You should've been done already .,0
There you go .,4
I don't think that you're done .,0
What's wrong ?,4
My hair looks hideous .,0
What's so bad about it ?,4
It doesn't look good at all .,0
Sorry about that .,4
I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this .,0
"Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ?",4
"David , I ' m going to China .",3
You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .,3
"Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate !",3
Thanks . Miss Zhang .,3
You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .,3
"Really ? I've already opened this one . Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit . Thank you ever so much .",6
You won ' t believe who ' s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ' Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !,0
Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .,0
"They were supposed to , but so far nobody ' s turned up , and I ' m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ' Ve had all day .",0
They ' re really running you into the ground . Why don ' t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere .,0
"What do you say to eating out , Maggie ?",3
"Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there .",3
Do we need to book a table in advance ?,3
No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays .,3
What time shall we go ?,3
Why not now ? I'm hungry .,3
"Look , who's here , Peter !",6
"Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris .",6
Just got back . Good to see you !,3
Good to see you too !,3
"Bill , Happy Halloween !",3
Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ?,3
I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs .,4
May I have a look at your costume ?,4
Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are .,4
I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool .,3
I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood .,3
Haha . Wish you good luck .,3
Hello ?,4
Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ?,4
"Oh , hi . I was just watching TV .",4
There's nothing to watch right now .,4
I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored .,4
Me too . Let's get together and do something .,3
"I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ?",3
Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow .,3
Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ?,4
I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny .,3
That's great . We can do something outdoors then .,3
Are there any special events going on tomorrow ?,4
Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow .,4
Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out .,4
Do you know what time it starts ?,4
It starts at one PM .,4
"Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there .",3
Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty .,3
There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester .,4
"Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ?",4
"To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring .",4
"I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ?",4
It might be the English teacher . What about you ?,4
"Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her .",4
She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English .,3
"Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing .",3
I think it's a good way to develop our language ability .,3
"Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us .",3
Can you believe me ?,3
Please count on my love .,3
I will .,3
I'll be yours through endless time .,3
I see . And I'll always be devoted to you .,3
"Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry .",3
I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie .,3
"My love will grow , like a river to flow .",3
"It can't be dry , and can't die .",3
I don't know whether we are in a dream .,3
"Aha , Aha ...",3
We'd like to have a look around your house ?,4
"Yes , of course , please follow me .",3
This is our courtyard .,4
"It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ?",4
"Yes , about 46 square metres .",4
Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ?,4
Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?,3
"They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time .",4
Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness .,3
How is night life in Beijing ?,3
Very interesting !,3
What do you suggest then ?,3
How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby .,3
"That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful .",3
"I'm glad you like it . The band is called "" Four and One "" . They are especially good at playing rock and roll .",3

"Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ?",3
"Yes , disco dancing is my favorite . It ' s great fun and good exercise as well .",3
OK . Let's disco .,3
Now the band is playing a slow dance .,3
That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ?,3

All right . Let me get you something to drink .,4
Would you like to go to a party tonight ?,3

May I come in ?,4
"Come in , please .",4
"I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise .",4
In 3 months or so .,4
You said the same thing three months ago .,4
"Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up .",6
You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ?,4
I got the message . I'm quiting .,0
"Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times . and I can't be handing out raises for anyone .",4
"I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't .",0
"I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do .",4
"Very well , consider me gone .",0
"I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ?",4

great . Let's go !,3

Why didn't you text me last night ?,4
What ? I sent you three or four messages !,6
I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message .,4
Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages .,0
"Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month .",4
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?,6
"I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages .",4
No wonder you didn't get my texts !,4
John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ' Ve got some good news !,3
Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning .,3
I am . Don ' t worry about getting your wallet . It ' s my treat .,3
This is a first ! You must have won the lottery .,6
"Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ?",4
Fine ! How are you ?,3
"I'm fine too , thank you .",3

"Yes , I do .",4
"Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly .",3
"Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully .",3
"Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot .",3
"No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off .",4
"Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you .",6
It's a promise .,4
I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,4
"Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ?",3
It was terrific . I really enjoyed it .,3
Great . How long were you away ?,3
I was there for about three weeks .,3
That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ?,6
"Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago .",3
"So , what was the best thing about your trip ?",3
"Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best .",3
"What's that , a new video game ?",4
Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do .,3
For instance ?,4
"It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer .",4
Wow ! Anything else ?,6
This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen .,3

Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go !,3

Jacob Hammer . He is originally from Holland .,4
That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin !,6
"It's really a small world , isn't it ! The Hammer family isn't very big .",6
It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ?,3
I always make time for family .,3
"I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine .",3
"I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time .",3
"Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty .",3
We are nor alone here . So many other families !,3
Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings .,3
"Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn .",4
"OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff .",4
"Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ?",6
"Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys .",4
Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ?,6
He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do .,4
"Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science .",4
"Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic !",6
I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world .,4
I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day .,4
"Well , OK . you are always right .",4
"So , how are you feeling today ?",4
I ' m pretty tired . I haven ' t been sleeping well .,5
Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ?,4
I have enough time . I just can ' t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep .,4
What time do you usually go to bed ?,4
I don ' t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired .,5
Have you been under a lot of stress lately ?,4
"I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one .",5
Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ?,4
"I haven ' t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea .",4
Do you like swimming ?,3
"Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors .",3
"Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems .",3
"I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch .",3
Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?,3
"Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance .",3
Would you like to come by and play bridge ?,4
"Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .",4
"Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .",4
"Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .",4
"Oh , we always go to the movies . Can ' t we do something different ?",4
"Well , do you have any suggestions ?",4
Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?,3
"It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .",3
"Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .",3
"Hello , Janet . It ' s me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?",3
this party rocks !,3
"you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here !",3
I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love !,4
"well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ?",4
"oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ?",4
yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me !,4
I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice .,4
"I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league .",4
come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try .,4
"okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game .",4
all right . But I think you ought to move soon .,4

I can see five other guys eying her up .,4
"okay , here I go !",3
good luck !,3
"Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ?",4
"Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ?",4
I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home .,3
That sounds great . Is it casual ?,3
"Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays .",3
That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up .,3
"Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people .",3
That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ?,3
"Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company .",4
Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .,3
Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited !,3
"Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ?",4
"You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it !",3
Really ? What kind of prizes ?,6
"Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car !",3
A new car ! You're kidding !,6
"No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear !",3
Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ?,6
"Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too !",3
"Gee , I don't think I own any red underwear , but I can buy some !",4
"Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ?",4
Stay away from me .,0
Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ?,4
"I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket .",0
"That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry .",4
Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you .,0
When do you want to have the open house party ?,4
How about next Friday ?,4
Friday sounds good .,3
How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ?,4
I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax .,3
That's what I was thinking .,3
"I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own .",3
Do you feel like a king in your castle ?,3
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?,0
"Sorry , I thought you knew .",4
But you should have told me you were in love with her .,0
Didn't I ?,4
You know you didn't .,0
"Well , I'm telling you now .",4
"Yes , but you might have told me before .",0
I didn't think you'd be interested .,4
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?,0
"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",4
"Oh , you men ! You're all the same .",0
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?,4
No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ?,4
What about a factory tour ?,4
You mean visit a factory ?,4
Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .,3
Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?,3
"I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .",3
Really ? What do the companies do that for ?,6
I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .,3
"Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .",3
Exactly .,3
Do we need an appointment beforehand ?,3
I'll call the tourist information centre to check .,3
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?,5
"You look a bit pale , don't you ?",4
"Yes , I can't sleep well every night .",5
You should get plenty of sleep .,4
I drink a lot of wine .,5
"If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .",4
I often feel so tired .,5
You better do some exercise every morning .,4
I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .,2
"Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .",4
"Hello , Steven . Congratulations !",3
How's your married life ?,3
We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple .,3
That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right .,3
The situation differs in person .,3
Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat .,4
"Fine with me , but no more chafing dish .",4
Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner .,3
I'd love to try some snacks .,3
( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ?,4
Kebabs and roast squid .,4
Can I have a bite ?,3
Help yourself .,3
Super !,3
Ah ! No ! Damn it !,0
It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .,4
So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .,0
Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?,6
"No , I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .",4
"I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .",4
I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .,1
What are we going to do now ?,4
I don't know . I feel like going out .,4
I wonder how much of the city is down .,4
It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .,4
"Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed . And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .",4
"Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .",0
"I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .",4
"On balance , dress designing appeals to me most .",3
"Yes , it's to my liking , too .",3
"Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?",3
It's my dream .,3
What do you do in your spare time ?,3
I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music .,3

12,4
Three or four o'clock ?,4
I never stay out that late . That's too late .,4
But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night . You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?,4
"Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?",4
"Yes , I was . And I like living here . People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party . But here , everyone does .",4
What is that they're doing on the couch ?,4
They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .,4
Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?,6
"But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail .",6
"Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America . But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan . If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .",4
I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ?,4
"I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better . Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to .",4
I don't want to .,4
That's alright . But you really should have another drink . People will probably start dancing soon .,4
I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .,4
"You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink .",4
I thought a university was for studying .,4
"It is . We study hard all week . And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live .",4
Alright . I'll have another drink .,4
Good morning . I ' m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ?,4

"Oh , I haven ' t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time .",4
Why don ' t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you .,3

"No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ?",4
"I live downtown , with my parents .",4
Do you have a car ?,4
I don't need a car . I walk to work .,3
You're lucky !,3
How do you like waltz ?,3
May I invite you for the first dance ?,3
My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer .,3
"In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too .",3
"Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well .",3

Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances .,3

Can I have a look as well ?,3
"Of course , have a seat .",3
"Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful .",3
"Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof .",3
"Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top .",3
"Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer .",3
"Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ?",3
"Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it .",3
"Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look .",3
It ' s for a job . It looks perfect for you .,3
"Let ' s see ... ' Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Betty Sue . ' Oh , I don ' t know ...",4
"Come on , what have you got to lose ?",4
What about my resume ?,4
"Here , I'll help you type one up .",3

What a terrible house !,1
"I'm sick of it , too .",1
"The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .",1

What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there .,4
Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?,4
Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ?,4
They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival .,4
"Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it .",3
It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life .,4
"Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth .",6
Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter .,3
"There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ?",4

You'll have to try for yourself some day .,3
I love Chinese food .,3
What's your favorite dish or dishes ?,4

"Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us .",4
"Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ?",4
"I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed .",4
"Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ?",4
"Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things .",4
"Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him .",4
"Oh , sure .",4
There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ?,4
What are the movies that are playing ?,4
There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon .,4
I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it .,3
"So , is that a yes ?",3
Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ?,3
"It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main .",4
Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater !,3
"Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf .",3
You're really sporty !,3
I want to do everything I can .,4
Do you have clubs ?,4
No . Can I rent clubs ?,4
There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times .,4
What kinds of clubs ?,4
Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 .,4
I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me .,3
What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ?,3
Sure . Where would you suggest ?,3
How about going to the suburbs ?,3
"It ' s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself .",3
Thanks to your help . To our friendship .,3
Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ?,3
Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us .,3
"Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys .",3
I'll surely make introductions for them .,3
"Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ?",4
I enjoy camping .,3
Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ?,6
"I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think .",3
Do you hike or fish on your trips ?,4
"Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles .",3
Did you catch anything ?,4
"Yes , but I threw them back .",4
How about Joining our summer camp next week ?,3
Great ! I can't wait .,3
what do you think about this store ? I heard it ' s a posh store that ' s only got branches in big cities .,3
I love this store . The only problem is that it ' s extremely expensive .,3
don ' t worry . I ' Ve decided that for your birthday I ' m going to take you shopping for a new dress .,3
really ? I thought you hated shopping ?,3
"I do , that ' s why you should appreciate this gift !",3
sure . That ' s really nice of you . Let ' s go in and try some things on .,3
how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .,3
that ' s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?,3
"here you go . On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ' s on special offer today .",3
I think this color isn ' t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?,3
"let me look . Let ' s see ... they ' Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .",3
this is perfect ! What do you think ?,3
I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !,3
I ' m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey !,3
What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night .,4
This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' .,3
I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember .,3
"Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in !",3
Can I read it when you're finished ?,3
Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping .,3
Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself .,4
Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either .,4
What dances do you like ?,4
I love to dance the fast music .,3
Then you must be interested in disco .,4
"Yes , it's my favorite .",3
"Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance .",4
You're a good dancer .,3
Thank you . Now they are playing a rumba . Would you have a try ?,4
Sorry . I feel like sitting out the next dance .,4
OK . Let's get something to drink .,3
"Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too .",3
I've said you will enjoy your life here !,3
"I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ?",3
"Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time .",3
My children would like that ; they like dancing very much .,3
That's good !,3
Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ?,6
"Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin .",6
"He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself .",6
He performs very well . He is so funny !,3
"OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family !",3
"OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ?",3
"Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour .",3
"OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot !",3
You are welcome ! We are neighbors !,3
I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday . It was very good .,3
I didn't know about it . What did you do ?,3
We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun .,3
You were really lucky .,3
"My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too .",3
I hope I can go to your party .,3
"It ' s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .",3
would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it .,4
"I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .",4
"Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ' t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ' t go together .",1
"I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .",4
"People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ' s more to do .",4
"I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ' re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .",3
"I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .",3
The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ' s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .,3
Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .,4
You ' re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !,1
it's getting cold .,4
yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look .,3
"Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern .",3
"yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?",3
"it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .",3
how about this blue sweater ?,3
that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?,3
"yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?",3
that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .,3
I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is .,3
perfect !,3
"you have good fashion sense , Karen .",3
thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there .,3
"yes , but with our sense we'll always look good .",3
Don't just stand outside . Come on in .,4
This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean .,4
Nice to meet you guys .,3
Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team .,4
Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ?,4
That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ?,3
He sure is !,3
Come on . I'll introduce you two .,3
"Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate .",3
"Thanks , Miss . Wang .",3
Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much .,1
"Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing .",3
It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult .,3
They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year .,3
"Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers .",3
"Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus .",3
Ha-ha ! You got me there !,3
How is everything going with your girlfriend ?,4
Didn't I tell you ? It's over !,0
"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?",4
"It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !",0
Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?,6
"No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !",0
What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?,4
"I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .",0
I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !,4
I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .,0
"I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?",4
I guess so .,4
So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea !,4
Hello ! So you are leaving today .,4
Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother .,3
It is my pleasure to see you off .,3
Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again .,3
"I hope so , too .",3
Thanks again for everything you have done for me .,3
You're welcome . Have a nice trip !,3
Didn ' t I tell you ? It ' s over !,0
"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ' t know that you had split up . What happened ?",4
Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ' t show up ?,6
"No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home !",0
"I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone .",0
I can ' t believe she would do that to you . It ' s so dishonest---and rude !,0
I know . I still haven ' t heard from her . The good thing is that I ' m so angry with her that I don ' t feel sad about not having her around .,0
"I bet you she regrets what she ' s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ' t she ?",4
I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though .,4
"I know . It ' s always nice to have some closure , but I don ' t think you ' ll have a problem finding another girlfriend .",4
"How are you , Sue ?",4
And how ' s your brother ?,4
He is fine .,4
"He ' s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?",4
Yes . He ' s already got the passport and visa .,4
"Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid !",3
Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ?,3
"Yes , it is . How do you know that ?",3
"Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ' t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting .",4
"Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ?",3
"I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .",4
"That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture .",4
I love this art exhibition !,3
"So do I . Let ' s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ?",3
"It's a lovely day , isn't it ?",4
"Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .",3
Is she American ?,4
"Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !",3
"So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?",4
I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .,4
Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?,4
Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .,4
"That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?",4
"You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .",3
Good luck !,3
Thanks !,3
"Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ?",4
"Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour .",4
"Well , Rose ,",4
Is there something you need ?,4
Are your free this weekend ?,4
"Yes , I have nothing to do .",4
"Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?",3
I beg your pardon ?,4
I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat .,3
"Really ? well , ok , you're welcome .",6
Is 5 PM . a good time for you ?,3
"Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner .",4
"Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine .",3
OK . Then I'll be expecting you .,3
I'll be there on time .,3
"wow , it that your sports car ?",3
"yes , do you like it ?",3
I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?,3
"it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .",4
what's wrong with it ?,4
"well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .",4
when's the last time you had it serviced ?,4
it must have been a few years ago now .,4
I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .,4
"they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !",4
what else is wrong with it ?,4
"the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car -- even in the summer !",4
anything else ?,4
the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .,4
why don't you get it all fixed ?,4
"it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !",4
"well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ' d love to go for a ride in it !",3
Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics .,3
"Merry Christmas , Linda !",3
"Merry Christmas , Lee !",3
"Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it .",3
Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it .,3
Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike !,0
"If I hear "" Love Me Tender "" one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy !",0
He sounds like a sick cow !,1
Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key .,4
I already tried that . Nothing seems to help .,4
Hey ! Where are you going ... ?,4
You look happy .,3
I am happy . I just bought a new car .,3
Wow ! Is it a good car ?,3
It ' s a great car . It ' s very comfortable and it goes really fast .,3
Was it expensive ?,4
Put it this way -- it wasn ' t cheap .,4
What colour is it ?,4
It ' s red and black .,4
I often go to a place of leisure .,3
I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine .,3
Sounds great .,3
"The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there .",3
How nice .,3
I may take you there some day .,3
Good .,3
"OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building .",3
It ' s huge .,3
Would you like to go to the top ?,3
The view is breath-taking .,3
The bridegroom looks a bit nervous .,4
"On this occasion , most people do .",4
"Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come .",3
She is a beautiful bride .,3
I am so happy for them .,3
Are you crying ?,3
"Yes , I always cry at weddings .",3
Harris and Anne are perfect for each other .,3
"Yes , they are .",3
You and Tom also make a great couple .,3
"In fact , we are beginning to make preparations .",4
For the wedding ?,4
"No , no , for the engagement .",4
Try to catch this bouquet then .,3
"What's up , buddy ? You look so upset .",4
I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ?,5
I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ?,4
"I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did .",5
Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call .,4
"I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet .",5
"Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person .",4
"Hello , Jason . Are you free this Saturday evening ?",4
Yes . I have no plans .,4
Would you like to Come to our barbecue ?,4
"Yes , that sounds wonderful .",4
OK . See you then .,4
"But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian",4
Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ?,6
"The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat .",4
Relly ? That's amazing .,6
"Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly .",4
Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet .,6
"Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try .",4
"Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat .",4
Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet .,4
"We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then !",3
"Mr . Green , I ' d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown .",3
"How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ' s a pleasure to get to know you .",3
"My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company .",3
I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation .,3
"Okay , let ' s make a toast .",3
"Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here !",3
"Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time .",3
"Fine , thank you , and you ?",3
Pretty good . What brings you here ?,4
I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block .,4
Have you got your invitation yet ?,4
"My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?",6
The house warming party .,4
Whose house warming party is it ?,4
Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .,4
"Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .",6
It's out in the suburbs .,4
Have you seen the house ?,4
"Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .",4
Is it nice ?,4
"Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden .",4
"Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?",3
"They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .",4
When are they going to have the party ?,4
Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .,4
"Wow , that would be something to look forward to .",3
"Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet !",4
Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else .,0
You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report .,4
"Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got .",0
It just happened to be the highest grade in the class .,4
You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it .,0
I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade .,4
If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it .,0
"Mrs . Smith , time has stood still with you !",3
Thank you . You ' re partial .,3
I'm not flattering you . You ' re full of energy every day .,3
It's nice to hear that anyway .,3
Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ?,3
Sounds good . When and where shall we meet ?,3
Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ?,3
"Fine , see you then .",3
"What are you listening now , Fred ?",4
"Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to .",4
Jay Chou's title song in his new album .,3
What's your comment on his new album ?,3
"Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile .",3
Let me enjoy it .,3
I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart .,3
I cann't wait for buying his CD now .,3
I enjoyed talking to you .,3
I enjoyed talking to you too .,3
We should hang out some time .,3
I think that would be nice .,3
Is there anything you would like to do next time ?,4
Do you want to go out to eat ?,4
I'd like that .,4
So I'll see you next time .,4
I'm going to call you soon .,4
I'll talk to you later .,4
See you soon .,4
Goodbye .,4
"Brooke , I have bad news .",4
I called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today .,4
Don't you dare tell me that ...,0
I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats .,5
"Well , they should have called you !",0
They said that they did . I've been so busy ...,5
And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ?,0
I didn't think there would be a problem .,4
It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !,0
I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me .,5
Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations !,0
Brooke !,4
What a good day !,3
Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city .,3
Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery .,3
"Great , let's go .",3
"Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .",3
"En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it .",3
"I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey .",3
"The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ...",3
I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good .,3
That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time .,3
"Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings .",3
You look pale recently .,4
Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work .,5
Take good care of yourself .,4
Thank you . I will .,5
"Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?",4
Pardon ?,6
What university would you enter ?,4
University ? Why ? You asked me last year .,6
"Oh , I forget . Sorry .",4
I went to Harvard University .,4
Did you ? And what course did you take there ?,4
God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?,6
"I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory .",4
I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ?,4
"Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A .",3
"London is such a historical city ! There ' s history everywhere you look . There ' s nelson ' s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ' s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .",3
"I ' m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader .",3
"Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ' s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain .",3
"Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ' s .",3
She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ?,3
There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow .,3
I ' m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too .,3
"I ' Ve seen them before . They ' re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ' s one place you have to go .",3
"Where ' s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ' s the waxworks museum .",3
"There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .",3
"Sometimes , it ' s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !",3
"Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?",4
"Not bad . We have had a big meeting today , remember ?",3
"Oh , yea . I forgot . So how did it go ?",4
Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .,3
"Great , so what happens now ?",3
"Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .",3
"Lucy , you ' re back . How was your first day of school ?",4
It was great . I had a really good time .,3
What classes did you have ?,4
"Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock .",4
What do you think about the teachers ?,4
"To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ' s so boring !",4
That ' s too bad . How was your English teacher ?,4
"She was great . In today ' s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .",4
Where is she from ?,4
She said that she ' s from a small town in the middle of America .,4
Were you able to understand everything that she said ?,4
"Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ' t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .",4
She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ' ll pass her class ?,4
Yes ... with flying colors !,3
"It ' s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !",3
"If you like the class this much already , I ' m sure you will .",4
I hope so .,4
did she give you any homework ?,4
"not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,",3
no wonder you like the class so much .,3
I've got some great news for you !,3
did you get the position you wanted ?,4
"yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .",3
I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !,3
"thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .",4
"sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !",3
thank you very much .,3
you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader .,3
I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon .,3
that's very nice of you to say so . I'll try my best . When will you start at the new position ?,4
next week .,4
"so by then , you'll be in charge of the whole department .",4
absolutely .,4
Terrible . How about people's lives ?,4
"Fortunately , there is no person died .",3
That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .,3
Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world .,4
That's why many people died in the earthquake .,4
"Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other .",4
"Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .",4
"Yeah , we've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman .",4
We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake .,4
"Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .",3
That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography .,4
Do you have any hobbies ?,4
Yes . I like gardening .,4
"Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ?",3
"Yes , follow me . Here it is .",3
Your garden is really lovely .,3
Do you take care of them everyday ?,4
Don't you feel dull ?,4
I don't . I like the work .,4
How was the movie last night ?,4
I didn't really like it .,1
Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .,4
I found it very disappointing .,1
"She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .",4
I wasn't happy with it .,1
Nothing is to your satisfaction .,4
What are you doing there with your mobile phone ?,3
I'm moblogging !,3
Moblogging ? what does that mean ?,6
"Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices .",3
Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .,3
"Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me .",3
How can you do that ?,4
"Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser .",4
What if you want to publish some photos ?,4
"Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog .",4
I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you .,3
You bet it !,3
"so , how should we go to the theatre ?",4
let's take the bus .,4
"I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .",1
it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .,4
"it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .",4
"we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .",4
"train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .",4
"if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?",4
"we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .",4
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .,4
fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .,4
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .,4
don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .,3
"thanks , that was nice of you .",3
"see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !",3
Are you doing anything tonight ?,4
"No , nothing . Why ?",4
Do you like western music ?,3
"Yes , I do , very much .",3
There ' s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ?,3
"Oh , yes . I ' d love to .",3
Aren ' t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world .,3
I just don ' t find it very interesting .,4
I think it ' s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .,3
"I think that for a lot of people , it ' s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries .",4
I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .,3
"I ' m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ' s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .",4
"You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .",4
Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics .,3
Now there we are in agreement !,3
Hi ! How are you going ?,4
"Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ?",4
Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time .,4
Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday .,4
Did you enjoy yourself ?,4
Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ?,3
"Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day .",3
You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye .,3
Goodbye .,3
What a busy week !,4
Really ! I've never seen so much work .,4
Right . How are you going to spend your weekend ?,4
I don't know . I have no idea .,4
Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ?,4
"I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible .",4
"You should try it . It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too . What do you say ?",4
"OK , but don't say I didn't warn you .",4
"That was a pretty good shot , Mary .",3
Thanks . This is fun !,3
Let me help you with your serve .,4
No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before . Maybe I should learn to do something .,4
"Of course , you can . All you need is a little help and a lot of practice .",4
Do you really think I can be a good player ?,4
"Well , maybe not a Michael Zhang , but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ?",3
Yes . This has been fun .,3
"Hi , Lucy !",3
"Hi . It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ?",3
"Yes , It's very great .",3
"Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ?",3
"You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money .",3
Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ?,3
Yes . Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet .,3
"Oh , I'll try to catch it .",3
"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?",4
Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?,4
"What ? Ed , don ' t tell me you only have bad news !",6
"Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .",4
For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?,0
"Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months .",4
What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ?,6
"Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .",4
Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !,6
"We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .",4
We ' re doomed !,0
There is some really good news though !,4
Really ? What !,6
I got offered a new job !,4
I suppose I do .,4
You said it .,4
This city is really comfortable to living .,3
It sure is .,4
"Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much .",4
"Hi , Jason !",4
"Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ?",4
With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ?,3
It will be held at the Central Music Hall .,4
What is on the program ?,4
"It ' s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know .",4
Hah ! OK . Let ' s go together !,3
Let ' s meet at the park at 6:00 .,3
Cheer !,3
So what time tomorrow ?,4
Half past seven in the morning .,4
Where to meet ?,4
In the market .,4
OK . Bottoms up .,3
Bottoms up .,3
It's on me .,3
Thank you . This place is nice .,3
Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages !,6
I've been really busy . How is everything ?,3
"Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?",3
"Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ?",3
"Oh , God . It ' s late . I ' m afraid I have to leave .",4
That ' s very kind of you . But if I don ' t go now I ' ll miss the last bus .,3
"How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ' ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise .",3
Well . I really do have to go .,3
Good night then .,3
See you tomorrow .,3
"Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday .",4
"Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?",4
"If you are free , maybe you can get having for my birthday party , it should be fun .",3
"Sounds great , i ' d very much like having something thanks , when ?",3
Around six pm .,3
Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .,3
"No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .",3
"Ok , I will see you again .",3
"Great . I have a good day , thanks again for the offer .",3
"I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester .",5
Have you tried university part-time jobs ?,4
"I mean in the library , or in some information center . Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .",4
"Yes , I know . I tried that . They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?",4
"Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard . That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .",4
I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal . But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .,5
"Anyway , there must be some solution . You know there are many people working illegally in New York .",4
But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .,4
I have an idea .,4
"Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown .",4
I already had that idea .,5
"Well , why don't you go and look down there ?",4
But I don't know what I would do .,4
"It may be part-time work as a waitress or something . It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .",4
Maybe . I don't know .,4
I will ask my friends for you . Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people . That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you . You might find something .,4
I have to find something . Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months .,5
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute .,4
"Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ?",4
"Thanks . Gee , it's really light !",3
"Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ?",3
I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look .,4
"Wow , that's really old .",3
"Yes , I like collecting antiques .",3
Why don't you get a new one ?,4
"I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .",4
"Really , what makes you say that ?",6
"Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?",4
"Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .",4
"Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?",3
Three . Two boys and a girl .,3
"Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you .",3
"Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase .",3
"Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much .",3
I am glad you like it .,3
"Oh , don ' t go yet . Let ' s at least have one more .",4
"No , thank you . I can ' t .",4
It ' s too bad that you have to leave so early .,4
Thank you very much . I had a really good time .,3
Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon .,3
"That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ' s assuming you don ' t mind if I call you sometime .",3
Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 .,3
"ok , got it . I ' ll call you sometime next week .",3
It ' s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon .,3
"I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben .",3
"Merry Christmas , Lily .",3
"The same to you , Joey .",3
This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you .,3
"It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?",3
"Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together .",4
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ?,4
"When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which -- is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?",4
"The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .",4
That's right . Why do you ask ?,4
"Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .",3
When are getting married ?,3
Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .,3
Congratulations ! I had no idea .,3
Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?,3
Do you like amusement parks ?,4
"For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .",4
"If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .",3
Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?,3
"Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .",3
Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .,3
I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !,3
Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ?,3
Is there anything good playing ?,4
Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster .,3
"Really ? I want to go , too .",6
"OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ' t be late .",3
( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ?,4
I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie .,4
Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story .,6
But their love is touching !,4
"Ah , you're just too emotional .",4
I am not !,4
"Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ?",4
"John , I am just not in the mood for this .",5
You look so upset . What's going on ?,4
I lost the table tennis game yesterday .,5
"Oh , what a pity !",4
I just don ' t want to play table tennis any more .,5
Is it that bad ? It ' s nothing more than a game .,4
My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis .,5
"Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ' t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed .",3
Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure .,3
I understand .,3
I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses .,3
"Oh my gosh , how exciting !",3
Will you come with me and help me choose ?,3
"Sure , I will . How can I miss that ?",3
Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror !,3
"Oh , don't . I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever !",3
"Hi , Mr . James , what's the rush ?",4
The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check .,4
I can lend you some money .,4
Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set .,3
Can I help in anyway ?,4
You can take me to the bank if you want to .,3
Sure . Let ' s go .,3
"I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .",0
You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .,4
"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .",4
"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" .",4
But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?,2
"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .",4
"Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .",2
"This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .",4
"Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .",4
"This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .",4
Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .,4
"Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion .",4
I'd be glad to tell you what I think .,3
Good ! I'm interested in your advice .,3
"If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .",4
"Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?",3
I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .,4
"You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ?",4
"Very good . But you should talk about your family , too .",3
I agree . I appreciate your helping me .,3
"Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department .",3
All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues .,3
You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding .,3
I just did what I should have done .,3
You ' Ve got a great personality .,3
Thank you for your compliments . I will try even harder to repay the company and your support .,3
I believe you will . I ' m very pleased with your work . Your promotion will contribute to the development of the company .,3
Thanks for saying so .,3
"Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on .",3
Thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not .,3
That's a good idea .,3
Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter ?,4
She might like a laptop computer .,4
"Yes , that sounds like a good idea .",3
Might I suggest a Mac ?,4
Okay . How much ?,4
"Well , a 15 - inch Pro is $ 2,100 .",4
"Oh , that sounds great . I'll take it .",3
Great . How would you like to pay for it ?,3
Here's my VISA .,4
"Let me ring you up . Okay , sign here , please .",4
Everything I need is in this box ?,4
It'll take her only a few minutes to get online .,4
Thank you for your help .,3
So long . Thank you for shopping here .,3
What did you cook ?,4
"Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes .",3
Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?,3
"Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !",3
This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !,3
Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .,3
This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !,3
"Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !",3
"Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !",3
Want some more ?,4
I'm stuffed !,4
"I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .",3
"Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .",3
How about the new bar across road ?,3
"Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too .",3
"I agree , I had lunch there last week .",3
excellent ! That sounds like a plan .,3
How's your business ?,4
Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it .,1
Things are tough all over . You should never give up !,4
But how can I prevent a deficit ?,4
I think you should make a thorough market investigation now .,3
"OK , OK . I ' ll do my best .",3
I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up .,3
"I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through .",3
"Yeah , you can make it .",3
"Happy birthday , John . Many happy returns of the day !",3
"Thank you , Alice . Come in to the dining-room . I ' m going to cut the cake soon . Have some please .",3
"Well , making good wishes .",4
Ok . I ' m pretty happy and I can go abroad .,3
Sure . We hope your wish will come true .,3
"What ' s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?",4
What ' s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job .,0
"Then , buy a bottle of soft drink .",4
Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ?,4
"It ' s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .",4
"Ok , I will go there myself .",4
"Sorry , Mr . Polly .",5
"It doesn ' t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ?",6
Have a try .,4
Nothing much . I ' m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ' s all I have planned .,4
So you ' re free on Saturday night ?,4
That ' s right .,3
Would you like to have dinner with me ?,3
"Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ' clock ?",3
Perfect . I ' ll pick you up then .,3
Who was the best teacher that you ever had ?,4
"That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher .",4
What was she like ?,4
"She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her .",3
What kind of things did you learn ?,4
She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do .,3
Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ?,6
"If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it .",4
You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ?,4
"She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined .",4
I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students .,4
Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ' t have any teacher ' s pets .,4
Really ? Doesn ' t every teacher have a teacher ' s pet ?,6
"Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ' t treat me any differently . She really didn ' t have any teacher ' s pets .",4
Do you know what she is doing now ?,4
"As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ' s book .",4
Have you ever read one of the books ?,4
Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books .,3
Why don ' t you recommend one to me ?,4
ok ! I ' ll bring one to you next time .,3
Good morning !,4
"Good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?",4
"I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares !",4
That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .,4
"I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .",4
"Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .",4
"That's annoying , but nothing to worry about .",4
"For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?",4
Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .,4
"Ok , I'll try that .",3
Is there anything else bothering you ?,4
Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .,4
Do you have any other plans this weekend ?,4
I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .,4
Try not to take on more than you can handle .,4
You're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks !,3
But you should tell me you were in love with her .,0
"Well , I am telling you now .",4
I didn't think you would be interested .,4
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?,0
"Oh , you men ! You are all the same .",0
This is my house . Let me show you around it .,3
How beautiful the detached house is !,3
Follow me to the back-yard .,3
"It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers .",3
We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning .,3
No wonder it smells fragrant .,3
Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later .,3
It's fantastic !,3
Are you free tonight ?,4
"Yes , I am . What's wrong ?",4
Would you please go to a dancing party with me ?,3
OK . No problem .,3
"As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .",4
But it's said that you dance wonderfully well .,4
"Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?",3
No . Just occasionally .,3
What are your favourite dances ?,3
I love rumba and waltz .,3
How about samba ?,3
"To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast .",3
Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ?,3
OK . See you then .,3
"Mr . Martin , we're on arrival .",3
It's nice of you to see my off at the airport . Thank you very much .,3
We'll miss you . I hope we'll keep in touch .,3
Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days .,3
It's my pleasure . We hope you'll visit Beijing again .,3
Certainly . I'll be glad to .,3
It's almost time to get aboard .,3
"Yes , we should go . Thank you very much . Goodbye !",3
Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey !,3
What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ?,3
"I enjoyed myself , too .",3
Shall I give you a ride home ?,3
"Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble .",3
It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place .,3
That's great . Let's go !,3
"Hey , Mark , long time no see .",3
Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ?,3
Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand .,3
Really ? How was it ?,3
Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back .,3
I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful .,3
"They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap .",3
I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ?,3
Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing .,3
I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself .,3
"Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ?",3
"Yeah , it sure would .",3
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter .,3
Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast .,3
Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us .,4
"Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .",4
"Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training .",3
I will do my best .,3
Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ?,4
"Actually , a friend of a friend .",4
My name is Phil . What's yours ?,4
Alecia .,4
Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good .,3
Thanks . They look delicious .,3
Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some .,3
That would be great . I would love some .,3
How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh . he's my Romeo !,3
"Hey , Julie . How's it going ?",4
"Oh , Mary . You've surprised me !",6
Who were you talking to ?,3
Um -- I was just thinking aloud .,3
You look so happy . I see a twinkle in your eyes .,3
"Come off it , Mary .",3
"Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes !",3
"You certainly do like teasing me , Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is , how do I get his attention ?",3
"Well , that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him .",3
I guess I asked the wrong person .,3
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now .,4
"What's your favorite course , Daniel ?",4
I like science most .,4
Science ? That's a surprise .,6
Surprise ?,6
I thought you would like PE .,4
"I do like PE , but I am interested in science .",4
Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it .,6
"Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly .",4
Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy .,4
Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in .,6
Hope so .,4
I believe that you called me ?,4
"Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly .",3
Why did you call me ?,4
I was calling about your son .,4
Did he do something wrong ?,4
Your son was acting up in class .,4
What do you mean ?,6
He was talking and causing a disturbance during class .,4
That's really not like him .,4
"If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it .",4
"I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again .",5
"Don't worry about it , but thank you very much .",3
"Why not ! It ' s a classic . In fact , it ' s one of my favorite novels .",4
Don ' t judge a book by its cover . Do you know what it ' s about ?,4
It would take a lot less time ...,4
( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight,3
Almost . I have to get dressed . It's a formal party and I have special party make up !,3
Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine !,3
"Great ! Uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . We all have to bring a gift .",3
I've already got mine .,3
( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents !,3
Here ! Open mine first .,3
Wow ! It's just what I wanted !,3
Hey ! Why don't I have any presents !,6
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?,0
"It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine .",4
"Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops .",0
"Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",0
"True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?",4
Not funny .,4
"Judy , what is everybody talking about ?",4
Haven ' t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager .,4
You ' re kidding . It can ' t be true .,6
Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company .,4
Me too .,6
What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ?,4
"I ' d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ?",4
I don't know . I failed my exam .,5
What did you get ?,4
A B plus .,4
That's not bad .,4
"But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true !",6
"Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ?",4
"No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know .",5
I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ?,4
You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder .,4
How ?,4
Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs .,4
Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning .,4
Then go to bed and have a good sleep .,4
I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend .,3
"Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams !",3
"Thanks , bye .",3
"How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ?",4
"Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby .",4
"Yeah , you ' re quite right and what ' s your hobby ?",3
I like taking photos out of doors .,4
"Oh , photography , It ' s really a good hobby .",3
"Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos .",3
You yourself have a photo studio ?,4
"Yes , simple as it is . It does work .",3
"Hi , Jenny . Are still working ?",4
"Hi , Nancy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books .",4
"So , you are leaving , aren't you ?",4
"Yes , I ' m going to take a holiday tomorrow .",4
How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you .,3
That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ?,3
"Yes , could you please go over this for me ? And see if there is any mistake in it ?",3
Oh . All right I'll read it soon .,4
Excuse me for taking your time .,3
It's nothing Nancy .,4
"What ' s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy .",4
I had a bad day yesterday .,5
I went to the library and lost my bag .,5
Your bag ? Did you get it back ?,4
I went back for it . But it was already gone .,4
That ' s too bad . I ' m sorry to hear that .,5
"Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here !",6
"Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time .",6
"How's life going , Zhang Lin ?",3
"Yes , the same as ever , thanks . What about you ?",3
"Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle .",3
"Good bye then , and keep in touch .",3
Good bye .,3
"Jack , what's wrong ?",4
You !,0
What are you talking about ? What did I do ?,4
You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ?,0
No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .,4
She started feeling suspicious after you said that .,4
I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up .,5
"Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you .",4
"Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends .",4
Don't bother .,0
I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian .,3
Where is she going to college ?,4
She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship .,4
Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again !,3
Good evening ! I don't believe we've met before . May I introduce myself ? My name is Jack .,4
It's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Lucy .,3
"I'm very happy to meet you . You're from the United States , aren't you ?",3
"Yes , I'm from Salt Lake City .",4
I've been to Salt Lake City a few times . I really like your city .,3
I'm glad to hear that . I think it's the nicest city in the United States .,3
"Hi , Bill . I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl .",4
"Yes , she is my favorite girl . I've decided to go steady with her .",3
Are you sure she is the right girl ?,4
"Sure . She is the ideal girl , the one I had dreamed of .",3
What type of girl is she ?,4
"She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her .",3
"Oh , that's great . You're serious this time .",3
How was school today ?,4
It was great . I made some friends .,3
"Really , that's good .",3
But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard .,5
They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it .,3
Do you know who ' s just got married ? Old McDonald .,4
"Never ! He ' s over 80 , isn ' t he ?",6
He ' s nearly 90 .,4
Good gracious ! Are you sure ?,6
"I am . What ' s more , his wife is 84 .",4
Is she really ?,6
"Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband .",4
"Really ? Quite a woman , isn ' t she ?",6
What date is it today ?,4
Look at the girls in the street . They all have a bunch of flowers . Is it Valentine's Day ?,4
"Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it .",6
Did you have a fight with Jack ?,4
"No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ?",0
"Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too .",4
"You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these "" big days "" , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable .",0
Is that your phone ?,4
"Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me .",3
Wow ! Good timing .,4
He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ?,3
Come on ! Three's a crowd !,4
So what ?,4
Just go ! It's Valentine's Day !,3
"Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ?",4
"Hi , bob . I ' m reading a biography ?",4
Who ' s it about ?,4
It ' s about Bob Dylan .,4
Who is he ?,4
He ' s a famous American musician .,4
Who ' s the author ?,4
It was written by Howard Sounds .,4
What do you think about it ?,4
It ' s great ! I ' Ve learned a lot from reading it .,3
Can I read it when you ' re done ?,3
"Sure , bob ! I ' m on chapter 12 now , so I ' m almost finished .",3
How many chapters does the book have ?,4
There are 15 chapters in total .,4
When do you think you ' ll have finished reading it ?,4
I should be done by Friday . I ' ll give it to you in class then .,3
Thanks . Charlie !,3
No problem . Bob .,3
"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",4
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",4
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,4
"Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .",6
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",4
"But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",4
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",4
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",4
"That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",4
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,4
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,4
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,4
How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?,6
"That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",4
"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",4
"Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",4
Why did they want to found a college ?,4
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .,4
"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .",4
When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?,4
"In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .",4
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .,4
"Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .",4
"Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .",4
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .,4
I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .,4
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,4
That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .,3
You can ask me any question at any time .,3
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .,4
"I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .",4
Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?,3
Why not ? I'd love to do that .,3
Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .,4
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?,3
Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?,4
I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .,4
"No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .",4
Unbelievable ! I could never do that .,6
Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum .,4
Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?,3
"Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ?",3
"Yes , let's do it .",3
Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them .,4
Of course not . We don't do that .,4
It's my new pendant . Do you like it ?,3
Is that Hello Kitty ?,3
"Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable !",3
Is it real gold ?,3
"Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow .",3
How did you first meet Jack each other ?,3
That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark .,3
And then ?,3
"I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? '",3
Then he sent you to your home ?,3
Yeah .,3
It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty .,3
He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .,3
He is so humorous .,3
"What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today .",4
I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ?,5
"Well , English is a "" paper tiger "" . Its natural enemy is adequate practice .",4
"I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words .",5
"I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language .",4
Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time .,6
"Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you .",3
"Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf .",3
I hope you will like it .,3
"Of course , I like it very much . Thank you .",3
Hi honey ! You ' ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married !,3
Wow that ' s great news ! They ' re a great couple !,3
I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ' s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ' s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .,3
"You aren ' t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ' t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ' s your friends party .",4
"Aw come on ! It ' s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top .",4
"Well , I don ' t know .",4
Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ' t mind you going to her bachelorette party !,4
"Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ' m organizing her party !",3
Your knowledge of English is really surprising .,6
"No , seriously . I'm impressed .",3
I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ?,4
It was terrific . The concert was really a hit . The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance .,3
Who was the conductor ?,4
"Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius . He did a perfect job . His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants .",3
"Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist .",3
Absolutely right . He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto . That caused a sensation . The audience were stunned by his pure tone .,3
Obviously you did enjoy the concert .,3
I have to talk to you !,0
"What , Hilary ? I ' m really in a hurry !",6
"I know , Blake . But you ' Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company .",0
"I ' Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ' t think it ' s worth it .",4
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would .,0
I'm sorry to have made you disappointed .,4
That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .,0
"Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize .",6
And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?,0
Forgive me darling . I'm very tired .,4
"Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ?",4
"Oh , I took up a new hobby .",4
So you don't travel a lot now ?,4
"No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now .",3
It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .,3
It certainly is . It's so much fun .,3
I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?,4
Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .,3
"Well , every stamp has a story to tell .",3
You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps .,3
Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections .,4
There's a lot to share when you have a common interest .,4
"Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors .",3
"Ok , good luck . See you",3
"See you , Frank .",3
"Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?",4
You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .,4
What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .,4
Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?,4
I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .,4
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .,4
That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .,3
"Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too .",3
Good . Let ' s go now .,3
"are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !",4
"I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week .",4
"Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...",4
"No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage . And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .",4
"What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .",6
"They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .",4
That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?,0
"I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .",4
it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now !,0
Have you heard of the Love Bug ?,4
Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ?,4
Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year .,1
This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ?,1
"Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it .",4
So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick .,1
How's your new car ?,3
Perfect ! Couldn't be better .,3
It's just what I want .,3
No regrets .,3
I am really pleased with it .,3
I am glad you are happy .,3
what a nice uniform !,3
thanks ; do you like it ?,3
not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ?,4
"yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional .",4
they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ?,4
"I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day .",4
so are you enjoying your new job ?,3
it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great .,3
how do you like working in sales ?,3
I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster .,3
that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department .,3
"yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman !",3
I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos !,3
how do you know her ?,6
she's my cousin .,4
why didn't you tell me about that before ?,6
I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting .,4
"well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime .",3
that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work .,3
"Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance .",4
"Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross .",4
That's really a good thing . Let's do our part .,3
Who will sing in the show ?,4
"A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ...",4
Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs !,3
Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself .,3
"Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile .",3
She is a real star . Not a onetime thing .,3
But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing !,3
"Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things .",3
"You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her .",3
Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?,3
Here is the programme . Check it out yourself !,3
"Happy Mother's Day , Mom !",3
Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have !,3
Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us .,3
"I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers .",3
"Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ?",4
"Bourbon , please .",4
"How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ?",4
"With iced water , please .",4
"Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water .",4
Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ?,3
The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16 . 5 dollars .,3
That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change .,3
When is your vacation going to start ?,3
I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation,3
"Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ?",3
I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter .,4
Where are you going now .,4
To the beach,4
Have you made your hotel reservation yet ?,4
"Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends",4
You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August,3
"Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy .",3
"Okay . Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?",4
"John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?",3

Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ' s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup .,4
What was that ?,4

"Let ' s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ' s start with the record collection , I ' ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back .",4
"Fine , but I ' m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me .",4
"I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it !",0
"He ' s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway !",0
"Whatever ! Alright , I ' ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ' ll agree that I get the silver tea set .",4
"How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ' t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ' s next ? What about these old photographs ?",4
"Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ?",4

"... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ...",3
"Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ' t we ?",3
"Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ' t reconcile and try again ? I still love you .",3

"This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ' t know the first thing about farming !",3
That ' s fine ! Don ' t worry about it !,3
"Relax , it was just a goat !",3
And that ?,4
It ' s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later .,3
"Honey , seriously , It ' s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .",3
You know what ? I don ' t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ' m going back to the city !,4

You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .,4
You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody .,4
I didn't do anything .,6
We've found some heroin at your house .,4
"No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff .",6
"That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking .",0
"I don't need your help , jerk .",0
Whatever you say .,4
"What ' s the matter , dear ?",4
"Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag .",5
"Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ?",4

No . But you mustn ' t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ?,4
No . I couldn ' t find a policeman .,5

It's such a nice day outside . Let ' s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping .,4
You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world .,4
"I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ' t cost you anything .",4
What kind of errands do we need to run ?,4
"Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor .",4
I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight .,4
"Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ' t have to carry it the whole time .",4
"Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers .",3

"Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start .",4

We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot .,4
I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together .,4

"I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split .",4
"Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice .",3
"Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ' Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks .",0

My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now .,5

How about the shelf ?,4
I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ?,5
Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go .,4
I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ?,5
"Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ?",4
"Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ?",3
You ' Ve put it among these journals .,4
My poor memory . Thank you very much .,3
"Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ?",4
"Total Fitness , why ?",4
"Well , I ' Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ' t like it there .",4
Really ? Why not ? I hear it ' s pretty good .,6
The people don ' t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time .,4
"Oh , it ' s one of those places .",4
"Yeah , is your club different ?",4
"Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ' t so many people .",4
Do they have a lot of equipment ?,4
"Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna .",4
Sounds nice . What about classes ?,3
"The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too .",4

Fine . How is Jim ?,3
"Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time .",3
Good idea !,3
"Can I help you , Madam ?",4
Yes . I'd like to buy a sweater for my husband . Which style is the latest ?,4
These are all the latest fashion . How do you like this white turtleneck one ?,4
I like this style . But do you have any other colors ? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion .,3
We also have it in grey .,4
Great ! I will take it . And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater ?,3
It's my pleasure . I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well .,3

It was really an exciting moment .,3
Who's that striking woman over there ?,4
"Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her .",4
Really ? Why not ? She looks great .,6
"Yes , I know , but she's dangerous .",4
Really ? Tell me more .,6
"Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment .",4
"Wow , crikey . So what happened ?",4
"Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman .",4
Wow .,6
"Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ?",4
I have no idea what you're talking about .,4
"Oh , come on . Everybody knows .",4
Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call,4
It's very cold tonight !,4

"0h , that would be nice of you .",3
I'll turn the heat up .,3
"Yes , please do that .",3
"Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are .",4
"To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day .",4
"First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work .",4
What did your boss say ?,4
"He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !",4
That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?,0
"That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident .",4
Is your boss Chinese ?,4
"No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .",4
What are you going to do ?,4
I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .,4
That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ?,3
That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer .,3
Don't mention it . That's what friends are for !,3
You are late .,4
"I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection .",5
Couldn't get connection ?,6
"Yes , your number is out of service .",4
Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right .,6
So I couldn't get through .,4
"It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ?",4
"Well , the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service .",4
I need to find a new place to live .,4
Yeah ? Why ? Don ' t you like living with me ?,6
"Oh , it ' s not you . I just want my own place .",4
"Well , check the newspaper .",4
Jeez ... I didn ' t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days .,6
"Yeah , prices have really gone up the past couple of years .",4
"Oh , here ' s one . It ' s looks like its in this neighborhood , $ 600 a month . That ' s not to bad .",3
"No , it ' s pretty good . Why not give the landlord a call ?",3
Hello . I ' m calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park . Could I take a look at it ? Yes . Tonight at six is fine . Thanks .,3
I feel pity for the old man .,5
I feel the same way .,5
It must be dreadful to grow old .,5
"It sure is . He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed .",5
Guess what ? I've got great news !,3
"Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?",4
"Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .",4
Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?,6
She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .,4
Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?,3
"It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .",4
Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?,4
"Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !",3
Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?,4
"I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .",4
I'm really looking forward to reading your column .,3
"Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?",4
"Sure , where would you like to go ?",4
Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .,4
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time .,3
I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime .,3
"Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party .",3
I will . See you later .,3
"Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly .",4
No foot gives out scent .,4
But don't forget you are in a cafe .,4
"Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed .",4
I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior .,0
Don ' t pretend you are a good God .,4
You should feel shameful for your behavior .,0
I've never experienced such a kind of feeling .,4
I'm really sick of you .,1
"Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ?",4
So shall we have lunch together ? I ' d like to take you this time .,4
"I ' d like to , but I can ' t .",4
I ' Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ' m behind schedule .,4
All right . Can we make it another time ?,3
"Sure , thanks .",3
I ' ll call you later . Bye .,3
"Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ?",3
Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited !,6
"Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ?",6
"You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it !",6
Really ? What kind of prizes ?,3
"Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car !",6
A new car ! You're kidding !,3
"No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear !",6
Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ?,3
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy .,1
How come you think of him that way ?,1
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy .,0
"I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .",0
How come you think of him that way ?,0
Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .,0
I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .,0
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy .,6
"I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .",6
How come you think of him that way ?,6
Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .,6
I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .,6
Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ?,6
Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy .,6
No regrets ?,3
I was thinking about it . Are you ?,3
Are you going to the party on Saturday ?,3
I was thinking about it . Are you ?,6
Are you going to the party on Saturday ?,6
"Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun .",6
"Really ? Well , what time does it start ?",3
It starts at 8,3
"Well , who all is going to be there ?",3
Everyone from school .,3
How do you know it's going to be so fun ?,3
How is everything going with your girlfriend ?,0
"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?",0
How is everything going with your girlfriend ?,6
Didn't I tell you ? It's over !,6
"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?",6
"It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !",6
Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?,0
What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?,0
I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !,0
Why ? What are they like ?,0
Have you ever talked to them about it ?,0
What did they say ?,0
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !,1
Why ? What are they like ?,1
Have you ever talked to them about it ?,1
What did they say ?,1
They soud like the neighbours from hell !,1
I thought you didn't talk to them much .,1
"I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .",1
What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?,1
Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .,1
Maybe you should think about moving .,1
They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !,1
"I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !",1
They both just talk about how great they are all the time .,1
"They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .",1
"Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .",1
How's your thesis going ?,5
What should I get Uncle Teddy ?,6
You could get him a tie .,6
What should I get Uncle Teddy ?,3
You could get him a tie .,3
Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .,3
Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .,3
"Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .",3
"He would think you were crazy , Caroline .",3
"Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .",3
How much do you want to spend ?,3
"Well , he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .",3
"Alright , I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .",3
"Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .",3
What should he have then ?,3
"I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .",3
I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .,3
Alright . We can go later then .,3
"We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .",3
What should I get Uncle Teddy ?,0
You could get him a tie .,0
Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .,0
Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .,0
"Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .",0
That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise . But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .,0
"He would think you were crazy , Caroline .",0
"Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . So I have to find something halfway between .",0
How much do you want to spend ?,0
"Well , he was very good to me . He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .",0
"Alright , I have an idea . You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .",0
Yes .,0
"Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .",0
What should he have then ?,0
"I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag . But more like a workbag or shoulder bag . You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .",0
I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag . Where can we buy one ?,0
I don't think this mall has a leather goods store . So we have to go to State Street .,0
Alright . We can go later then .,0
"We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .",0
Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?,0
She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .,0
Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them . And what about Dad ?,0
How about the iguana ?,0
I think it would be a great joke . But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us . So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .,0
A tie ?,0
"Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet !",0
You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report .,0
It just happened to be the highest grade in the class .,0
I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade .,0
When do you want to have the open house party ?,3

What did your boss say ?,0
"He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !",0

"That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident .",3
Is your boss Chinese ?,3
"No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .",3
What are you going to do ?,3
I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .,3
May I come in ?,6
"Come in , please .",6

In 3 months or so .,0
You said the same thing three months ago .,0
"Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up .",0
You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ?,0
"Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times . and I can't be handing out raises for anyone .",0
"I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do .",0
"Julia , are you free tonight ?",3
What's up ?,3

"Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?",6
Yes .,6
"Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .",6

"Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .",3

She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .,3
"It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .",3
Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?,3
Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?,3
"I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .",3
"Sure , come with me . Hello , Michael , this is Steven . He will be part of your team .",3
"Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here !",3

There are no countries marked on the map .,3
"No , there aren ' t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .",3
"The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .",3
I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .,3
Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you .,3
The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .,3

Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?,6
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?,0
What ? Why do we have to do that ?,0
"Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .",0

"I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",6
"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !",6
Is she American ?,3
"So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?",3
I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .,3
Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?,3
Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .,3
"That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?",3
It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .,3
So what do you see in there ?,3

Can you afford that much ?,3
"No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .",3
"Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment . Usually one large room and a small bathroom . There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .",3
How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?,3
That means the apartment has furniture in it .,3
"Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .",3
Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .,3
It's still pretty expensive .,3
"Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .",3
Alright . What's the phone number ?,3
256-7797 .,3
Got it . What else do you see ?,3
This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate . Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment . Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?,3
"No . It probably means they have a large apartment . Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms . They need someone for the empty bedroom .",3
"Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all . If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .",3
"Here's the number , 256-4367 .",3
Got it . Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .,3

That's not very fair . What did you do ?,1
That's not very fair . What did you do ?,0

What ?,6
They killed another hostage .,6
"Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do .",6
I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ?,6
"Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us .",6
"Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ?",6
"I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed .",6
"Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ?",6
"Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things .",6
Hi honey ! What ' s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?,0
No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ' t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !,0
"I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ' t have the willpower to just quit . I can ' t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?",0

Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,2
That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you .,2
"Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .",2
"Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly .",0

I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting .,3
What are you doing this Saturday ?,3
Not much .,3
What's playing at the Century Fox ?,3
Candlelight in the Window,3
I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies .,3
No . I heard that's really boring .,3
I'm so glad we decided to go on a cruise for our vacation .,3
They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too .,3
Okay . I chose this swimming suit . Do you like it ?,3
Did you bring some lunch with you ?,3
"This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move .",6
You do ?,6
"Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too .",6
No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together !,3
"Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck .",6
No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil !,3
I got it on sale down at the department store .,3
When did you go there ?,3
"I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale .",3
I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ?,3
Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles .,3
I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .,3
That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated .,3
"Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties .",3
"Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?",3
"Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ?",3
I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back .,3
Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans .,3
I guess that you will really be dressing down .,3
That's my style when I'm not in the office .,3
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ?,3
Okay ! What do you suggest ?,3
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ?,6
Okay ! What do you suggest ?,6
How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater .,6
Is that so ? Why not ?,6
"( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead .",3

Ah ... I fancy going to the later show .,3

"Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work .",3
That sounds good . Where do you want to play ?,3
"We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work .",3
How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close .,3
How much does it cost over there ?,3
Twilight rates are 21 dollars .,3
Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4,3
Make it 4,3
"Yes , we can also see some yew trees .",3

What school do you go to ?,3
I go to PCC .,3
Do you like it there ?,3
It's okay . It's a really big campus .,3
Sure . What's this one a picture of ?,3
"Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .",3
You don't look very happy in that picture .,3
"No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !",3
So what did you do ?,3
"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ' t know that you had split up . What happened ?",0
Didn ' t I tell you ? It ' s over !,6
"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ' t know that you had split up . What happened ?",6
Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ' t show up ?,0
Can you believe the headlines ?,1
What are you reading ?,1
"I ' m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King .",1
He got arrested all right .,1
"Didn ' t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ' t he ?",1
The Blacks got divorced .,6
Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side .,6
"Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?",6
"No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time .",6
The Blacks got divorced .,3
Really ? Why ?,3
Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side .,3
"Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?",3
"No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time .",3
"Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ?",3
Excuse me . What did you say ?,6
A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games,6
You have to . It's sure .,6
It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ?,3
"Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ?",3
"I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ?",3
Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work .,3
"Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ?",3
"hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ?",3
part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?,3
"oh , it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?",3
"sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .",3
"yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .",3
that ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?,3
"you mean you got working experience , right ?",3
it must be very demanding .,3
of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .,3
not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .,3
"sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ' s easy to figure out .",3
maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around .,3
"I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ?",6
sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?,6
how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .,6
"well , what do you have in mind ?",6
how about the Mongolian hot pot ?,6
"I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ?",3
sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?,3
how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them .,3
"dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new !",3
"well , what do you have in mind ?",3
how about the Mongolian hot pot ?,3
"oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up !",3
maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base .,3
yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines .,3
"Oh , my God ! What's this ?",6
Look ! This window is open .,6
Did you open it before we left ?,6
I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ?,6
"Oh , my God ! What's this ?",0
What ?,0
Look ! This window is open .,0
Did you open it before we left ?,0
Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ?,0
I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ?,0
"No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house .",0
It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in .,0
I locked it when I left though .,0
"Yes , but the robber broke in . Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked .",0
How about you ? Have you got any news from university ?,3
No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it .,3
Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ?,5
I'm sorry . When did this happen ?,5
What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you .,5
"He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better .",5
It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week .,5
"Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside .",3
"Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break .",3
"Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry .",3
"Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town !",3
Then forgive her mistake .,5
"So , how are you feeling today ?",5
Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ?,5
What time do you usually go to bed ?,5
I have enough time . I just can ' t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep .,5
Have you been under a lot of stress lately ?,5
Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ?,3
I hate to ask you to do something like that .,3
When could we get together ?,3
I could easily give you some time tomorrow night .,3
"Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ?",3
They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .,3
"Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go",3
"Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too .",3
I have to talk to you !,6
"What , Hilary ? I ' m really in a hurry !",0
"Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody .",3
"It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ?",3
"Hello , Anna speaking !",3
"Hey , Anna , this is Jason .",3
"Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?",3
"Yes . How are you , Anna ?",3
I am fine . What have you been doing ?,3
Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .,3
"Hello , Anna speaking !",6
"Hey , Anna , this is Jason .",6
"Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?",6
"Yes . How are you , Anna ?",6
I am fine . What have you been doing ?,6
Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .,6
"That's great , congratulations !",6
"Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .",6
That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .,6
You are kidding .,3
How long have you been working there ?,3
"A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ' t the only factor in deciding promotions .",3
How do you like your new boss ?,3
"Much better than the last one , huh ?",3
Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk .,3
8 it is . See you then .,3
Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .,2
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ?,3
Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ?,3
I'm thinking about taking his class next semester .,3
He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ?,3
"I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades .",3
"Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ?",3
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?,3
Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ?,3
I'm almost done .,0
I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .,0
I'm all done now .,0
I don't understand .,0
You're spending a very long time on my hair .,1
I'm almost done .,1
I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .,1
I'm all done now .,1
Are you sure you're finished ?,1
I don't understand .,1
What's wrong with it ?,1
You did a horrible job on my hair .,1
"Then , what shall we do on Sunday .",3
"Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment .",6
"Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment .",3
"Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place .",3
"Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon .",3
No problem . Call me when you get back .,3
"I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ?",3
"Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday .",3
Does it look like a good fit ?,3
How do you prefer to pay ?,3
Let me use my credit card .,3
"Now , if you'll just sign here .",3
"What ' s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?",0
"What ' s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?",5
What ' s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job .,5
"Then , buy a bottle of soft drink .",5
Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ?,5
"Ok , I will go there myself .",5
"It ' s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .",5
"What ' s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ?",6
What ' s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job .,6
"Then , buy a bottle of soft drink .",6
Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ?,6
"It ' s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .",6
"Ok , I will go there myself .",6
"Sorry , Mr . Polly .",6
I really should be on my way .,3
"Oh , don ' t go yet . Let ' s at least have one more .",3
"No , thank you . I can ' t .",3
It ' s too bad that you have to leave so early .,3
"Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time .",3
"Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here !",3
"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",6
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",6
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,6
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",6
"But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",6
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",6
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",6
"That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",6
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,6
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,6
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,6
"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",3
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,3
"Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .",3
"Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",3
"But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",3
"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",3
"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",3

Really ?,3
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,3
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,3
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,3
How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?,3
"That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",3
"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",3
"Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",3
Why did they want to found a college ?,3
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .,3
"Oh , I see .",3
"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .",3
When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?,3
"In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .",3
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .,3
"Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .",3
"Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .",3
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .,3
I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .,3
"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?",3
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,3
Are you free this Saturday evening ?,3
"Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening .",3
At our club .,3
When ?,3
At 7:30 p . m .,3
"I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away .",0
I knew this would happen some day .,0
"Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too .",0
I think we can still talk .,0
"I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away .",1
I knew this would happen some day .,1
"Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ?",1
I think we can still talk .,1
No way ! Please don't follow me around .,1
"Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ?",1
"Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too .",1
I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life !,1
"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous , so everyone loves them .",0
I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .,0
"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ?",0
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .,0
"Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea",0
I think you should give them some credit . They ' re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves,0
it's getting cold .,3
"Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ?",0
Why do you say such words ? I love you very much .,0
"Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ' s .",0
"Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply .",0
"But honey , I think you ' re terrific . There is nothing ...",0
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now .,6
"What's your favorite course , Daniel ?",6
I like science most .,6
I thought you would like PE .,6
"I do like PE , but I am interested in science .",6
"Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly .",6
Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy .,6
"It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system .",3
Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .,3
Is that where you park ?,3
"Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in .",3
"It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system .",6
That's pretty advanced .,6
Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .,6
Is that where you park ?,6
"Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in .",6
Thank you . Where is your key ?,6
"There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .",6
"There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .",3
"That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment .",3
Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out .,3
"Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?",3
"When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .",3
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .,3
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .,6
"Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .",6
What does it come with standard ?,6
"On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well . The Accord com",6
Cruise control ? I don't like that .,6
What does it come with standard ?,3
"On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player . But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well . The Accord com",3
Cruise control ? I don't like that .,3
"Why not , sir ?",3
I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?,3
"Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .",3
I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .,3
"You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .",3
I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?,3
"No , the sunroof is optional , sir .",3
I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .,3
"Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .",3
"We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .",3
"I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?",3
"Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?",3
My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .,3
"Yes , you can . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .",3
What ?,3
Guess what came in the mail today ?,6
My acceptance letter to Yale !,6
Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ?,6
"Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .",6
You ' re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ?,6
"Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes .",6
When can you do that ?,6
"Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?",6
Sure . What can you choose from ?,6
"Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .",6
What is your major ?,6
"I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ' ll see .",6
What are the fundamental course ?,6
"In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art .",6
Interesting . That ' s very different from the Chinese education system .,6
"Yes , it is . It ' s also very different from the British education system .",6
"Yes . I ' ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes .",3

why not ?,3
"oh , sure . In British , students don ' t have to take the foundation course .",3
How did you spend the weekend ?,6
I went to a movie with my boyfriend .,6
How did you spend the weekend ?,3
I went to a movie with my boyfriend .,3
"Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?",3
The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you .,3
"Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .",3
"Mary , be calm .",0
"No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you .",0

I drink a lot of wine .,2
"If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .",2
I often feel so tired .,2
You better do some exercise every morning .,2
"What's up , buddy ? You look so upset .",5
I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ?,5
Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call .,5
"Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate .",1
"Thanks , Miss . Wang .",1
You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .,1
What's in the box ?,3
"Sandy , I think we made a mistake ...",3
What do you mean ?,3
What's in the box ?,6
"Sandy , I think we made a mistake ...",6
It's a cute little teddy bear !,6
How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !,6
And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card .,3
"Going to the gym tonight , Mary ?",3
"Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong .",3
Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us .,3
"Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course .",3
No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me .,3
This is my favourite restaurant .,6
It looks very nice and the food looks delicious .,6
"Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before .",6
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ?,3
"Yes , we're making plans for a tour .",3
That'll be lovely . Where are you going ?,3
"Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday .",3
"Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then .",3
"Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ?",0
Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ?,0
"That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry .",0
"Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ?",3
"Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ?",6
I enjoy camping .,6
Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ?,3
Do you hike or fish on your trips ?,3
Did you catch anything ?,3
"Yes , but I threw them back .",3
Good game ?,6
Not bad . But too hot for me today .,6
"Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ?",6
Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?,6
"Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners .",6
Good game ?,3
Not bad . But too hot for me today .,3
"Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ?",3
Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?,3
"Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners .",3
"Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ?",3
16 . Yours ?,3
"Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?",3
"Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .",3
16 . Yours ?,6
"No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob .",6
Jane . Nice to meet you .,6
"Me too . So , do you like the course ?",6
"Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?",6
"Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .",6
"Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .",6
"Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .",6
"Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?",6
"Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !",6
"How awful , poor guy .",6
"Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him .",6
How do you know ?,3
"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?",6
Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?,6
"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?",0
Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?,0
"What ? Ed , don ' t tell me you only have bad news !",0
"Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess .",0

For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?,6
"Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months .",6
"Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .",6
"Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months .",0
What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ?,0
"Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost .",0
Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !,0
"We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .",0
"We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .",6
We ' re doomed !,6
There is some really good news though !,6
"Hey , what's up ?",3
"Oh , nothing .",3
What were you writing ?,3
You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !,3
"But , you work with her everyday .",3
You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ?,3
"Hey , what's up ?",6
"Oh , nothing .",6
What were you writing ?,6
( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk .,6
You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !,6
I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person .,6
"But , you work with her everyday .",6
"That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red .",6
You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ?,6
"Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea .",6
"Well , I guess you don't want this note , then .",6
What note ?,6
I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .,6
"Well , I guess you don't want this note , then .",3
What note ?,3
I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .,3
You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything .,3
"Jack , what's wrong ?",0
What are you talking about ? What did I do ?,0
"Jack , what's wrong ?",5
You !,5
What are you talking about ? What did I do ?,5
You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ?,5
No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .,5
She started feeling suspicious after you said that .,5
No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends .,0
She started feeling suspicious after you said that .,0
I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up .,0
"Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you .",0
"Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends .",0
Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ?,3
Are you enjoying married life ?,3
Look what you've done !,5
"I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately .",0
"Yes , and hurry up !",5
Look what you've done !,5
"I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately .",5
"Yes , and hurry up !",5
I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ?,5
"No , I'll do it myself .",5
"Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ?",5
"I should think so , too !",5

"I should think so , too !",0
I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble .,0
"Yes , and please be more careful in the future !",5
"I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .",3
I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?,3
My paper is on the influence of television on children .,3
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .,3
It's very cold tonight !,3
"Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?",6
"Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates .",6
What position do you play ?,6
I ' m a defender . It ' s a lot of fun . You don ' t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .,6

This is our courtyard .,3

"Yes , about 46 square metres .",3
Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ?,3

"So Alex , you ' re off to the Olympic stadium then ?",3
"Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ' s 400m relay .",3

I am . Don ' t worry about getting your wallet . It ' s my treat .,6
"Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .",6
Oh where was that ?,6
I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .,6
Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .,6
"Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?",6
She will be 86 next month .,6
"Hi , Becky , what's up ?",3
"Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .",3
What's the problem ?,3
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .,3
For example ?,3
"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .",3
"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .",3
It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .,3
"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .",3
You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?,3
"We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .",3
Not at all .,3
"Hello , this is 5735647 5 .",6
"Hello , this is John . I wanna speak to Linda , please .",6
This is Linda .,6
"Hi , Linda . I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening .",6

"Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ?",3
"Hi , Linda . I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening .",3
Thank you . Bye .,3
"It's a fine day today , isn't it ?",6
"Yes , it is . It ' s wonderful after the downpour .",6
How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .,6
I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .,6
"Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year .",6
You're right . We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow .,6
"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?",3
What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?,3
"It ' s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ' m an Aries . When were you born ?",3
January 5th .,3
"That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .",3
"No , it ' s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .",3
"Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?",3
I've enjoyed conversing with you .,0
I've got to go .,0
I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking .,0
"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .",6
"Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .",6
To me English is a difficult language .,6
A second language is always difficult .,6
"True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language .",6
"It ' s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ' t wear perfume .",3
I ' m sorry . I didn ' t know that .,3
"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?",3

"Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?",6
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !,6
That ' s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .,6
What does that mean ?,6
"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ' s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ' s begin ! I need a volunteer .",6
Me ! Me !,6
"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .",6
Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .,6
"Well , OK . But no French kissing !",6
"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ' s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .",6
Do you take a bus to and from work ?,1
"Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .",1
"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .",1

"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .",0
"Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .",0
"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .",0
What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?,0
"Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance .",3

But my Rose is great .,0
Your Rose is a fool .,0
"David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ?",3
It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched .,3
"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?",3
Why are they all in glass boxes ?,3
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .,3
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?,3
"No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box .",3
I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?,3
"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?",6

So how did you propose ?,3
You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now .,3
What do you think I should do ?,3
I never thought about that .,3
Thought about what ?,3
Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ?,3
I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .,3
"There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .",3

how did the business trip go ?,1
"I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !",1
I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !,1
our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .,1

Let's enter it !,6
I can't open the door .,6
It must be locked .,6
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office .,6
She can't answer you .,6
She must be deaf .,6
It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ?,6
We ' re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ?,6
Sure . I ' Ve never seen a dragon boat race .,6
Really ? I think you ' ll love it .,3
"Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?",3
You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .,3
What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .,3
Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?,3
I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .,3
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .,3
Are you doing anything tonight ?,3

I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students .,3
Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ' t have any teacher ' s pets .,3
Really ? Doesn ' t every teacher have a teacher ' s pet ?,3
"Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ' t treat me any differently . She really didn ' t have any teacher ' s pets .",3
Do you know what she is doing now ?,3
"As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ' s book .",3
Have you ever read one of the books ?,3
Why don ' t you recommend one to me ?,3
"It ' s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean .",1
would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it .,1
"I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .",1
What do you mean ?,1
would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it .,3
"I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .",3
"Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ' t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ' t go together .",3
"I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .",3
"People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ' s more to do .",3
"I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .",1

"I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ' re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .",1
"I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .",1
The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ' s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful .,1
Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .,1
"Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs .",2
"Honey , it's just windy and raining outside .",2
"Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it .",3

What sort of western food do you like best ?,3
I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ?,3
"Well , making good wishes .",3
What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ?,1
Don ' t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ' t be so bad ...,1
"Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces .",3
"How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose . This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw .",3
"That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different .",3
Janet Jackson is more pop music . Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes .,3

"No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ?",3

Wow ! Good timing .,3
Come on ! Three's a crowd !,3
So what ?,3
"Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ' t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting .",3
"I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings .",3
"That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture .",3
"Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone .",3
"You are not going to give it up , are you ?",3
"Yes , but whom to ?",3
"No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either .",3
I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .,3

We've found some heroin at your house .,0
"No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff .",0
"Hot in here , isn't it ?",3

Is it Ok if I sit here ?,3
Of course . Suit yourself .,3

We are through .,6
We are through .,5
Why ?,5
"Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day .",5
"I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her .",0
"But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home .",5
That girl was my cousin .,0
You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone .,5
I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time .,0
I don't buy a story .,5
"I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow .",0
"What ' s the matter , dear ?",5

That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .,3
"I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .",3
"That's annoying , but nothing to worry about .",3
"Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .",3
"For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?",3
Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .,3
Is there anything else bothering you ?,3
Do you have any other plans this weekend ?,3
Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .,3

So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?,3
"That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !",3
Have you ever written up a business plan before ?,3
"Well , no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?",3
"Well , that seems easy enough .",3
Geez . Is that all ?,3
"You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .",3
"Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .",3
"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !",3
"It's a lovely day , isn't it ?",6
"Yes , the weather sure is nice today .",6
I love it when the weather is like this . Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?,6
"I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day .",6
"Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .",6
"That sounds like a good idea . The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .",6
"David , what have you been up to lately ?",6
I went on a trip with my family last week .,6
"David , what have you been up to lately ?",3

Why ?,2
Are you excited about your trip next month ?,6
"Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified .",6
"Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying .",6
"I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad .",6
Calm down . Madam .,0
I am very sorry to hear that you ' Ve been having so many problems .,0
"I understand why you ' re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out .",0
Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .,2
What part hurts ?,2
The shoulder .,2
"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .",2
C'mon . Just don't move .,2
"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",2
"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",2
"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",2
Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,2
"Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here .",6
"I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife .",6
"I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ?",3
We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot .,3
I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together .,3
"That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months .",3
"I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split .",3
"Hi , Francis .",3
"Oh , Mike . How are you doing ?",3
Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart .,3
"Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too .",3
"Oh , I haven ' t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time .",3
"Really , where did you get it ?",3
I got it from Macy's .,3
It's really nice .,3
I can ' t believe it !,0
What ' s wrong ? That was a great goal .,0
Looks like you ' re going to lose out on this game then .,0
What were the odds ?,0
Are you free tonight ?,3
"Yes , I am . What's wrong ?",3
"As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .",3
But it's said that you dance wonderfully well .,3
"Come in , come in !",0
I thought we were supposed to meet HERE .,0
I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .,0
You ' re right . I am sorry . Let ' s go and watch the movie .,0
I wouldn't do it if I were you .,3
"It's very dangerous , you know .",3
"It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you .",3
"Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ?",1

It's a very popular game in America .,3
Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ?,3
Are you a football player ?,3
What is two hand touch and flag football ?,3
"Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .",3
"For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .",3
"No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football .",3
I see . It's safer then right ?,3

You mean because you are a woman ?,3
Yes . And he is the president of the company .,3
"Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond . He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all . He appreciates people for their ideas . And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women .",3
"I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs .",3

What's wrong ?,2
"I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .",2
You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .,2
"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .",2
"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" .",2
"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .",2
What do you mean by that ?,3
You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything .,3
"Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?",3
I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .,3
Then I must go-you have said it yourself .,0

That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines .,6

No way !,3
"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .",3
"Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ?",3

"Really , what makes you say that ?",3
"Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?",3
"Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .",3
"Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?",6
What university would you enter ?,6

I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ?,3
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?,6
Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ?,6
"I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .",6
That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?,6
"I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy .",6
"If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ?",6
"I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .",6
You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .,6
"The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .",6
The Taj it is then .,6
Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?,6
They'll still charge us a corkage fee .,6
That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .,6
Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight .,6
Are you sure ? We could go Dutch .,3
May I take your order now ?,3
"Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ?",3
Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .,3
The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?,3
"Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .",3
"Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar .",3
"Then , how about this one ?",3
OK . I'll have that .,3
"Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ?",3
"Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ?",3
"Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company .",3
I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking .,5
"I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please .",0
"How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you .",5
"You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go .",0
It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility .,5
"I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you .",0
I told you I happened to be more important meeting at that time .,0
Any day except Tuesday .,3
How about Thursday ?,3
"Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ?",3
"Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ?",3
What a busy week !,3
Really ! I've never seen so much work .,3
Right . How are you going to spend your weekend ?,3
I don't know . I have no idea .,3
Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ?,3
"I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible .",3
"You should try it . It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too . What do you say ?",3
"OK , but don't say I didn't warn you .",3
Let me help you with your serve .,3
No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before . Maybe I should learn to do something .,3
"Of course , you can . All you need is a little help and a lot of practice .",3
Do you really think I can be a good player ?,3
"How do you like skiing , Pat ?",3
I suppose skiing is easy for you .,3
"No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better .",3

"How do you like skiing , Pat ?",2
I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year .,2

Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night .,2
That sounds great .,2
"Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ?",2
Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg,3
"Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ?",3

"Steven , why are you so depressed ?",3
I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper .,3
What's the news ?,3
"According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake .",3

Oh !,0
What fools we were !,0
To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me .,0

"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !",3
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .,3
"So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?",3

"I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .",6
"I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .",6

I have plenty of gas .,3
"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",3
So what can we do ?,3

I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .,3
Doesn't sound promising .,3
"Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug .",3
If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .,3

"Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time .",6
My children would like that ; they like dancing very much .,6
That's good !,6
Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ?,3
"Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin .",3

"Yes , I think so .",6
"Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk .",6
"Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know .",6

Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? What ? Why do we have to do that ?,6
"Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? What ? Why do we have to do that ? Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !",0

In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !",6

Your dress really goes well with your shoes . I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? I got it on sale down at the department store . When did you go there ? I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . I guess that you will really be dressing down . That's my style when I'm not in the office . Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles .",3

"Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! Where did you end up going ? Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? Sure . What's this one a picture of ? Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . You don't look very happy in that picture . No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! So what did you do ? We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .",3

I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .",3

What about me ? I ' m your friend . I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ' s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? Not at all . I ' Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . That ' s a good idea . What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? I ' m not sure . I guess I ' d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club .",3

Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic !",6

People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . Any other common customs of your New Year ? Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . What's that ? It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too .",3

"Hi , Becky , what's up ? Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . What's the problem ? She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . For example ? Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .",3

I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ? You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . Well , that seems easy enough . Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . Geez . Is that all ? Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !",3

My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .

But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .",2

Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",0

"Terrible . How about people's lives ? Fortunately , there is no person died . That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . Yeah .

Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . Yeah , we've experienced the 8 . 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .",3
