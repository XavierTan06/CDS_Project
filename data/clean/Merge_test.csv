i feel like if you can t admit that you ve always been a little bit weird or a little bit quirky it s just taking yourself too seriously,6
Why is this still not banned,0
If only life was a garbage isekai anime. Too bad the genre is just pandering and blatant self-insert/wish fulfillment. Oh well.,1

So the article is pretty much nonsense.,1
i remember feeling impatient with the endless and convoluted fairy tale that was told throughout the book,0
