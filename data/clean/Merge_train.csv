Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ? I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .

"It ' s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it . I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . What do you mean ? Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ' t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ' t go together . I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ' s more to do . I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ' re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ' s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . You ' re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country !",1.0

That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . That makes sense . I'm going to try that . You don't need to lose weight .

Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers .

And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh .

But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .

"so , how should we go to the theatre ? let's take the bus . I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . thanks , that was nice of you . see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !",3.0

We have great discounts for students . I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ?

"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . Really ? Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . Why did they want to found a college ? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . Oh , I see . Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you . You can ask me any question at any time .",3.0

Since he doesn ' t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . Won ' t they get his inheritance ? No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . I see . This sounds interesting !

Whoa , that ' s a lot of cash ! Let ' s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ' s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .",5.0

They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . I thought you didn't talk to them much .

Some of your ties are pretty outdated . Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . Me too .
